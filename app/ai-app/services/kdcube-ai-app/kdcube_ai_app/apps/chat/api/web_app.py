bundles_async in the config listener.
- kdcube_ai_app/apps/chat/api/opex/routines.py: Uses cleanup_old_git_bundles_async in the cleanup loop.

Why This Matters

- The JWKS sync call was the only thing in the gateway path that could “freeze” the whole event loop for seconds right after restart. That’s now async with caching.
- Git bundle handling can no longer stall your async request path or config listener loop.

What to Watch Now

- Use the logs you already have to validate the pipeline:
- [sse_chat] received request …
- enqueue_chat_task_atomic result … enqueue_ms=… ingress_to_enqueue_ms=…
- Process … acquired task … queue_wait_ms=…
- Starting task … queue_wait_ms=… current_load=…
- If you still see long gaps between the browser send time and [sse_chat] received request, the delay is client‑side (UI gating, fetch timing, or websocket/SSE lifecycle), not
server‑side.

Capacity Tuning for 15 Beta Users
Your current config yields actual_capacity=14 (matches your logs) because:

- concurrent_per_process=5
- processes_per_instance=1
- capacity_buffer=0.2
- queue_depth_multiplier=2

For 15 concurrent users with 25s avg turns, you will queue and/or reject. Suggested starting point:

- CHAT_APP_PARALLELISM=3 (or 2 if CPU is tight)
- MAX_CONCURRENT_CHAT=5 (per process)
- queue_depth_multiplier=3 (if memory allows)
- MAX_QUEUE_SIZE increase (if you’re hitting “queue full” errors)

Also, since your admin reload can burst 15–20 requests, consider:

- Raising rate_limits.registered.burst and rate_limits.privileged.burst.
- Keep admin endpoints behind auth_without_pressure where possible (already in place for some).

Notes

- I didn’t run tests.
- The new JWKS logic honors JWKS_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS and adds optional JWKS_HTTP_TIMEOUT_S (default 5s).

If you want, I can add a “request timeline” tracing log (with a shared request_id) so you can see a single line per request with all milestones and durations.

Next Steps

1. Restart the service and send a first request after cold start; check if the previous “start delay” disappears.
2. Run a 15‑user burst test and check queue_wait_ms and backpressure logs.
3. If delays persist, we should add frontend timing logs around the SSE send path and compare to server timestamps.


› can yiou help me emulate this burst somehow in my monitoring. we have this 'builtin registry of users' for hardoced auth. /Users/elenaviter/src/kdcube/kdcube-ai-app/app/ai-app/
    services/kdcube-ai-app/kdcube_ai_app/apps/chat/api/idp_users.json. we could have here 15 users with role registered, 15 with admin. we will have to make 15 subscriptions to check
    paid but that's for later. i have 2 clients /Users/elenaviter/src/kdcube/ai-customers-solutions/cisoteria/ui/src/components/chat/ChatService.ts /Users/elenaviter/src/kdcube/ai-
    customers-solutions/cisoteria/ui/src/components/chat/ChatInterface/ChatInterface.tsx /Users/elenaviter/src/kdcube/ai-customers-solutions/cisoteria/ui/src/components/chat/
    ChatService.ts and second client is /Users/elenaviter/src/kdcube/kdcube-ai-app/app/ai-app/ui/chat-web-app/src/features/chatController/sseChat.ts /Users/elenaviter/src/kdcube/
    kdcube-ai-app/app/ai-app/ui/chat-web-app/src/features/chat/chatServiceMiddleware.ts. So in this admin app can we simulate the burst? With tokens of these users? so we can have such
    load interface in the gateway console.  /Users/elenaviter/src/kdcube/kdcube-ai-app/app/ai-app/services/kdcube-ai-app/kdcube_ai_app/apps/chat/api/monitoring/
    ControlPlaneMonitoringDashboard.tsx


• Here’s a working burst simulator path wired into the Gateway Monitoring dashboard, using your SimpleIDP tokens.

What I added

1. More SimpleIDP users (15 admin + 15 registered)
Updated kdcube-ai-app/app/ai-app/services/kdcube-ai-app/kdcube_ai_app/apps/chat/api/idp_users.json with:
    - test-admin-token-001 … test-admin-token-015
    - test-chat-token-001 … test-chat-token-015
2. Dev-only monitoring endpoint to read those tokens
GET /admin/burst/users in kdcube-ai-app/app/ai-app/services/kdcube-ai-app/kdcube_ai_app/apps/chat/api/monitoring/monitoring.py
Guarded by:
- MONITORING_BURST_ENABLE=1
- AUTH_PROVIDER=simple
3. Burst Simulator UI in the Gateway Monitoring dashboard
Added a “Burst Simulator” card in
kdcube-ai-app/app/ai-app/services/kdcube-ai-app/kdcube_ai_app/apps/chat/api/monitoring/ControlPlaneMonitoringDashboard.tsx
- Loads tokens from /admin/burst/users
- Opens N SSE streams (admin + registered)
- Sends M chat messages per user with a concurrency limit
- Shows status + open stream count

———

## How to use it

Env flags (service runtime):

MONITORING_BURST_ENABLE=1
AUTH_PROVIDER=simple

Make sure SimpleIDP is reading the correct file
If you set IDP_DB_PATH, it must point to:

kdcube-ai-app/app/ai-app/services/kdcube-ai-app/kdcube_ai_app/apps/chat/api/idp_users.json

If you don’t set it, SimpleIDP uses ./idp_users.json relative to the service cwd.

Then in the Gateway Monitoring UI

- Click Load tokens
- Set Admin streams / Registered streams
- Click Open SSE
- Click Send chat burst

———

## What this burst does (exactly)

- Opens SSE streams using bearer_token query param
- Sends POST /sse/chat with Authorization: Bearer <token>
- Each message uses a unique conversation_id so you don’t hit conversation_busy by default
- Optional bundle_id field is passed in the message if you provide it

———

## Files changed

- kdcube-ai-app/app/ai-app/services/kdcube-ai-app/kdcube_ai_app/apps/chat/api/idp_users.json
- kdcube-ai-app/app/ai-app/services/kdcube-ai-app/kdcube_ai_app/apps/chat/api/monitoring/monitoring.py
- kdcube-ai-app/app/ai-app/services/kdcube-ai-app/kdcube_ai_app/apps/chat/api/monitoring/ControlPlaneMonitoringDashboard.tsx

———

If you want, I can also:

1. Add a REST burst (e.g. /profile, /conversations) for admin reload patterns.
2. Add a “paid” burst (once you add paid users).
3. Add a server-side burst runner (no browser limits, better for large load).

Just tell me which path you want next.

• Fixed. The regex was double-escaped in the TSX.

                                             Updated in kdcube-ai-app/app/ai-app/services/kdcube-ai-app/kdcube_ai_app/apps/chat/api/monitoring/ControlPlaneMonitoringDashboard.tsx:

replace(/\/$/, '')

Reload the monitoring dashboard and the inline Babel error should be gone.


› please explain how to use . i get Enable with `MONITORING_BURST_ENABLE=1` and `AUTH_PROVIDER=simple`.. this must be on server ?


• Yes — those two flags must be set on the server (chat service) environment, because the monitoring endpoint /admin/burst/users is served by the backend and is disabled unless those
env vars are set.

Here’s the minimal setup:

    Server env

AUTH_PROVIDER=simple
MONITORING_BURST_ENABLE=1

Optional but recommended
Make sure the SimpleIDP file path is correct:

IDP_DB_PATH=/Users/elenaviter/src/kdcube/kdcube-ai-app/app/ai-app/services/kdcube-ai-app/kdcube_ai_app/apps/chat/api/idp_users.json

Then use the UI

1. Open the Gateway Monitoring dashboard.
2. Click Load tokens.
3. Choose counts for Admin/Registered streams.
4. Click Open SSE.
5. Click Send chat burst.

If you still see “Enable with …” after setting the env, it means the backend process didn’t pick up the env vars (restart required), or the monitoring endpoint is running in a
different container/process that doesn’t have them.


› Burst users not loaded. IDP_DB_PATH env var also must be set ?


• Yes — if you don’t set IDP_DB_PATH, SimpleIDP defaults to ./idp_users.json relative to the service working directory. That usually isn’t the file you edited, so /admin/burst/users
can’t find the new users.

So set all three on the server:

    AUTH_PROVIDER=simple
MONITORING_BURST_ENABLE=1
IDP_DB_PATH=/Users/elenaviter/src/kdcube/kdcube-ai-app/app/ai-app/services/kdcube-ai-app/kdcube_ai_app/apps/chat/api/idp_users.json

Then restart the chat service.

If after restart you still see “Burst users not loaded”, check:

- The service logs for /admin/burst/users errors.
- That the file exists at that exact path and is readable by the service.
- That you’re hitting the correct instance (port/env).

If you want, I can add a small log in /admin/burst/users to print the resolved IDP_DB_PATH so it’s visible in logs.

i get throttling and these events keep appear in log. why ? my only changes was MONITORING_BURST_ENABLE=1 in .env


• Short answer: that log is the rate‑limiter doing its job. MONITORING_BURST_ENABLE=1 does not create traffic — it only exposes /admin/burst/users. The throttling is coming from some
    client actually sending too many requests in a short window, and they’re all landing on the same session (714391f0).

What the log means

             - burst_rate_limit is triggered in RateLimiter.check_and_record(...)
             - Default privileged burst is 200 requests / 60s
                                                            - If one session sends >200 requests in that window, you’ll see exactly this

Common reasons

1. You ran the burst simulator with only one admin token (so all requests share the same session id).
2. You opened many /sse/stream connections with one token (SSE connect goes through gateway middleware).
3. A client is polling /sse/conv_status.get or /sse/chat too aggressively with the same token.

———

## How to confirm the exact endpoint

Use Redis Browser and inspect the last throttling event.

Key is namespaced:

    <tenant>:<project>:kdcube:throttling:events

Use ZREVRANGE (latest first) and inspect the JSON. It includes endpoint and session_id. That will tell you what’s spamming.

———

## How to stop the throttling (for test)

Pick one:

1. Use multiple tokens (recommended)
In Burst Simulator:

- Admin streams: 15
                 - Registered streams: 15
This distributes traffic across 30 sessions instead of 1.

2. Reduce burst rate
Lower:

- Messages / user
- Concurrency

3. Raise burst limit for privileged (testing)
In Gateway Monitoring “Update Config” panel, set:

    "rate_limits": {
                       "privileged": { "hourly": -1, "burst": 1000, "burst_window": 60 }
                   }

                   or set burst: -1 to disable burst limit entirely for privileged.

———

If you want, I can add a “burst test” banner that shows which endpoint is throttling right inside the Monitoring UI so you don’t need Redis Browser for this.


› yes, and also now that things settled and admin is loaded, i still have a problem "Burst users not loaded".


• Yes — and I’ve made it easier to diagnose.

I updated the monitoring UI so it shows the exact reason when /admin/burst/users fails, and I added a “Latest throttle” banner that shows the throttled endpoint.

## Why you still see “Burst users not loaded”

That message appears when the UI could not fetch /admin/burst/users. Common causes:

    1. Backend env not set or not loaded
                                  - Must be set in the chat service environment, then restart.

AUTH_PROVIDER=simple
MONITORING_BURST_ENABLE=1
IDP_DB_PATH=/Users/elenaviter/src/kdcube/kdcube-ai-app/app/ai-app/services/kdcube-ai-app/kdcube_ai_app/apps/chat/api/idp_users.json
2. Wrong instance / port
         - The monitoring UI uses settings.getBaseUrl() which defaults to http://localhost:8010.
If your backend is running on another port/host, the UI is calling the wrong server.
3. File path mismatch
             - If IDP_DB_PATH isn’t set, SimpleIDP looks for ./idp_users.json in the backend’s working directory, which usually isn’t your edited file.

———

## What I changed (so you can see the error)

Now, when /admin/burst/users fails, the UI shows the actual backend detail message (e.g. “Burst simulator is disabled” or “AUTH_PROVIDER must be simple”).

This change is in:
    kdcube-ai-app/app/ai-app/services/kdcube-ai-app/kdcube_ai_app/apps/chat/api/monitoring/ControlPlaneMonitoringDashboard.tsx

———

## New “Latest throttle” banner

Also added a banner showing reason + endpoint for throttling (so you can see exactly what was rate‑limited).

———

If you want, I can also log the resolved IDP_DB_PATH on the server side when /admin/burst/users is hit — that makes it 100% clear which file the backend is reading.


› tehse are set      AUTH_PROVIDER=simple
MONITORING_BURST_ENABLE=1 and as for IDP_DB_PATH= it muts look in that file which is relative to service entrypoint which is /Users/elenaviter/src/kdcube/kdcube-ai-app/app/ai-
app/services/kdcube-ai-app/kdcube_ai_app/apps/chat/api/web_app.py and right near is /Users/elenaviter/src/kdcube/kdcube-ai-app/app/ai-app/services/kdcube-ai-app/kdcube_ai_app/apps/
chat/api/idp_users.json


• Short answer: IDP_DB_PATH is NOT relative to web_app.py.
It’s relative to the server process working directory (cwd). By default it’s ./idp_users.json, which usually resolves to something like /Users/elenaviter/src/kdcube/idp_users.json,
not the chat/api folder.

So if you don’t set IDP_DB_PATH, the backend won’t read the file you edited.

## What you should do

Set it explicitly to the absolute path:

AUTH_PROVIDER=simple
MONITORING_BURST_ENABLE=1
IDP_DB_PATH=/Users/elenaviter/src/kdcube/kdcube-ai-app/app/ai-app/services/kdcube-ai-app/kdcube_ai_app/apps/chat/api/idp_users.json

Then restart the chat service.

———

## Why you still see “Burst users not loaded”

That message means /admin/burst/users failed. Common causes:

1. Wrong working dir → file not found
2. Env not loaded in the actual server process
3. Backend instance mismatch (monitoring UI hitting a different host/port than the one you set env for)

Now the UI should show a real error message (I updated it to display detail), so you’ll see exactly which one it is.

———

## Quick sanity check (curl)

From your machine, try:

    curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer test-admin-token-123" http://localhost:8010/admin/burst/users

    If it fails:

    - 404 → MONITORING_BURST_ENABLE not set in that server process
    - 400 → AUTH_PROVIDER not simple
    - 500 → file path invalid (IDP_DB_PATH)

    ———

    If you want, I can also log IDP_DB_PATH and cwd inside /admin/burst/users so it’s visible in logs every time you hit it.


› {"detail":"Burst simulator is disabled"}%


• That response means the backend process you’re hitting does not have MONITORING_BURST_ENABLE=1 in its environment.

This isn’t about the file path yet — the server short‑circuits before reading IDP_DB_PATH.

## Fix

Set the env in the actual process that runs the chat service, then restart it.

Examples:

PyCharm run config
Add:

AUTH_PROVIDER=simple
MONITORING_BURST_ENABLE=1
IDP_DB_PATH=/Users/elenaviter/src/kdcube/kdcube-ai-app/app/ai-app/services/kdcube-ai-app/kdcube_ai_app/apps/chat/api/idp_users.json

Docker / docker-compose
Add to the service env section (or .env used by compose), then restart container.

Verify

curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer test-admin-token-123" http://localhost:8010/admin/burst/users

If it still says “disabled”, you’re hitting a different instance/port than the one you restarted.


› wroks. i now get to "send chat burst" and ui write "Sending 20 messages…" but no activity in network and no activity on serrver. this admin interface is in iframe - can that be a
reason?


• Yes — the iframe can absolutely be the reason. The UI is running, but network can still be blocked by:

1. sandbox on the iframe (common in admin embeds)
If the iframe uses sandbox without allow-same-origin, the frame’s origin becomes null and fetch/EventSource can be blocked or CORS‑rejected.
You need at least:

sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"

If you see allow-forms or allow-popups that’s fine, but allow-same-origin is the critical one.
2. CSP connect-src restrictions
If the frame’s HTML response includes Content-Security-Policy that doesn’t allow your API base URL, the browser will block all fetch/EventSource — and you’ll see “no network” in
DevTools.

———

## Quick Isolation Test (2 minutes)

1. Right‑click the iframe → Open frame in new tab.
2. Click Open SSE, then Send chat burst in that new tab.

If it works there → the parent iframe restrictions are the cause (sandbox/CSP).

———

## What to check

A. iframe tag (parent page)

- Does it include sandbox?
If yes, make sure it includes:

allow-scripts allow-same-origin

B. CSP header on the iframe content

- If you have a CSP, confirm connect-src includes the API base URL, e.g.:

connect-src 'self' http://localhost:8010;
(or your real host)

C. Base URL

- If the iframe loads from a different domain/port, make sure the monitoring dashboard’s baseUrl is correct.

———

## What “no activity in network” usually means

- The browser blocked the request before it was sent (CSP or sandbox).
You should see an error in the iframe’s console, not the parent page’s console.

———

If you want, I can add a small “Test /health” button and a display of baseUrl + window.location.origin directly in the Burst Simulator so you can instantly see whether the frame is
running in an opaque origin or pointing to the wrong API.


› First of all, we write these admin interfaces such that they fully can use REST on backend and that works always.
Second, i now observe following:
I had couple of tabs opened from browser (same client).
And then when i opened connections and started sending the 20 messages from the simulator in one of them, the server received somehting like this for each (i think for each) client

and all teh clients are now seems like blocked.
when i reload the page of any other client the network shows pending requests to sse

ciso&user_timezone=Europe%2FBerlin&user_utc_offset_min=60&bearer_token=test-admin-token-123

noone can connect.
and in the server logs i even do not see attempts to connect on clients reload.
i use this client /Users/elenaviter/src/third/cisoteria/cisoteria_chatbot/src/ciso/app/ui/chat-web-app/src/components/chat/Chat.tsx /Users/elenaviter/src/third/cisoteria/
cisoteria_chatbot/src/ciso/app/ui/chat-web-app/src/components/chat/ChatService.ts


• The key clue is this URL:

http://localhost:5173/sse/stream?...

That means your client is not calling the backend (8010) at all. It’s calling the frontend dev server, so the backend never logs anything.

This is why you see “pending” in the browser and no server logs.

———

## Why this happens

In your client:

getChatBaseAddress() returns CHAT_WEB_APP_CHAT_API_BASE_PATH (default '').
When it’s empty, ChatService.connect() falls back to:

const baseForUrl = this.baseUrl || window.location.origin;

So it uses window.location.origin = http://localhost:5173.

Unless your Vite dev server is proxying /sse to the backend, the request never reaches the backend.

———

## Fix (recommended)

Set the backend base URL in the UI env:

CHAT_WEB_APP_CHAT_API_BASE_PATH=http://localhost:8010

Then restart the UI dev server.

That will make SSE go directly to 8010 and you’ll see server logs again.

———

## Alternative fix (proxy)

If you want to keep /sse going through the dev server, make sure Vite proxies it:

// vite.config.ts
server: {
    proxy: {
        '/sse': { target: 'http://localhost:8010', changeOrigin: true },
        '/profile': { target: 'http://localhost:8010', changeOrigin: true },
        '/api': { target: 'http://localhost:8010', changeOrigin: true },
        '/integrations': { target: 'http://localhost:8010', changeOrigin: true },
        '/monitoring': { target: 'http://localhost:8010', changeOrigin: true },
        '/admin': { target: 'http://localhost:8010', changeOrigin: true },
    }
}

———

## About the ServiceCommunicator log

listen() ended WITHOUT exception ... subscribed=[]

That just means all session channels were released. It is normal when all SSE clients disconnect. It won’t block new connections as long as they reach the backend.

———

If you want, I can add a guard in ChatService to log the exact base URL it’s using, so this is visible immediately in the console.


› update: when i pressed "close sse" in the simulator that released other tabs. maybe browser limit?


• Yes — this is almost certainly the browser’s per‑origin SSE connection limit.

Most browsers limit ~6 concurrent HTTP/1.1 connections per origin (Chrome/Edge/Safari).
SSE uses a long‑lived connection, so once you open several SSE streams on the same origin, other tabs block or queue.

That matches what you saw:

- Simulator opens multiple SSE streams → other tabs “hang”
- When you click “Close SSE”, those connections drop → other tabs reconnect

———

## What to do

Best practice for this test:

- Keep 1 SSE stream per browser tab
- For load testing, run the burst simulator in a separate browser profile or another browser (e.g., Chrome + Firefox)

If you need lots of SSE connections in one browser:

- Use different origins (e.g., localhost:8010, 127.0.0.1:8010, localhost:8011), or
- Use HTTP/2 and ensure your server + browser are using it (H2 allows more concurrent streams)

———

## For your use case

Your real users will each have one SSE stream, so this browser limit isn’t a server problem — it’s an artifact of running many “users” in one browser instance.

———

If you want, I can modify the Burst Simulator so it does not open SSE streams by default and only sends chat bursts via REST — so you can stress the queue without exhausting browser
connections.


› i think we use http 2.0. how to know?


• Quick ways to confirm HTTP/2:

1. Browser DevTools (most reliable)

1. Open DevTools → Network.
2. Right‑click the header row → enable Protocol.
3. Reload.
4. Check the Protocol column:
- h2 = HTTP/2
- http/1.1 = HTTP/1.1

2. curl

curl -I --http2 -v https://your-host

Look for HTTP/2 in the response. If it falls back to HTTP/1.1, the server doesn’t support H2 or TLS is missing.

Important

- Browsers only use HTTP/2 over HTTPS.
- If you’re hitting http://localhost:8010 (no TLS), you are on HTTP/1.1.
- If you’re behind a reverse proxy (nginx/ALB) that terminates TLS, HTTP/2 may be enabled at the proxy, while the app server itself still speaks HTTP/1.1.

If you tell me your exact URL (http/https + host), I can tell you which is likely in play.


› http (i am running locally). pleas help and make server side load test. let's have it here /Users/elenaviter/src/kdcube/kdcube-ai-app/app/ai-app/services/kdcube-ai-app/
kdcube_ai_app/infra/load/test. please also give me very clear cases how i can run to simulate needed load and how i profile what happens (with our gateway monitor if possible).


• Done. I added a server‑side load generator and updated the monitoring cheat‑sheet with clear run cases + profiling guidance.

## What I added

Load test script

- kdcube_ai_app/infra/load/test/burst_sse_load.py
- Runs from the server host (not browser), so no SSE browser limits.
- Can open SSE streams per user or send chat burst without SSE.
- Can optionally call /monitoring/system before/after to snapshot queue/throttling.

Docs

- Updated kdcube_ai_app/docs/service/maintenance/requests-monitoring-README.md
with commands and profiling steps.

## How to profile during the test

Open Gateway Monitoring and watch:

- Queue Analytics
- Queue Utilization
- Throttling (Recent)

Logs:

- enqueue_chat_task_atomic result
- acquired task
- Starting task

Redis Browser:

- Queue keys: <tenant>:<project>:kdcube:chat:prompt:queue:*
- Heartbeats: <tenant>:<project>:kdcube:heartbeat:process:*

———

If you want, I can add:

1. An admin page burst mode (simulate dashboard reload calls)
2. A mixed SSE+REST mode (chat + conv_status.get)
3. JSON report output for comparison across runs


› regardin case 1 - what does it mean - no SSE?


• Case 1 means: we only send /sse/chat requests, but we do not open /sse/stream connections.

So:

- Enqueue + processor + backend load happens normally.
- Events don’t get delivered to a client, because no SSE stream is listening.
- This is pure server‑side load, useful to stress queues and processing without hitting browser limits.

If you want to test real end‑to‑end streaming, use --open-sse (Case 2).

• You don’t need to add __init__.py everywhere. The error is just because Python can’t see the package root on PYTHONPATH.

### Quick fix (recommended)

Run from the service root and set PYTHONPATH:

cd /Users/elenaviter/src/kdcube/kdcube-ai-app/app/ai-app/services/kdcube-ai-app
PYTHONPATH=. python -m kdcube_ai_app.infra.load.test.burst_sse_load \
                       --base-url http://localhost:8010 \
                                                   --registered 15 --admin 0 \
                                                                           --messages-per-user 1 \
                                                                                               --concurrency 10 \
                                                                                                             --monitor

### Alternative (no -m, no PYTHONPATH)

python /Users/elenaviter/src/kdcube/kdcube-ai-app/app/ai-app/services/kdcube-ai-app/kdcube_ai_app/infra/load/test/burst_sse_load.py \
--base-url http://localhost:8010 \
                            --registered 15 --admin 0 \
                                                    --messages-per-user 1 \
                                                                        --concurrency 10 \
                                                                                      --monitor

No extra __init__.py needed for this. The problem was just the working directory / module path.

. no any 15 users.


• You actually did send only 1 message. That’s why you see only one run in logs.

### Why only 1?

Your test run didn’t find any users beyond the first one. The script fell back to one registered user because it loaded only the single default token from the SimpleIDP file it
found.

The most likely reason: the script is reading a different idp_users.json than the one you edited.

———

## Fix: point the script to the correct file

Use the absolute path explicitly:

python -m kdcube_ai_app.infra.load.test.burst_sse_load \
          --base-url http://localhost:8010 \
                                      --registered 15 --admin 0 \
                                                              --messages-per-user 1 \
                                                                                  --concurrency 10 \
                                                                                                --monitor \
                                                                                                --idp-path /Users/elenaviter/src/kdcube/kdcube-ai-app/app/ai-app/services/kdcube-ai-app/kdcube_ai_app/apps/chat/api/idp_users.json

This will guarantee it loads the 15 tokens.

———

## Also: your run failed due to economics limits

The stack trace shows:

EconomicsLimitException: Project Budget exhausted ...

That means the request reached the processor but was stopped by budget policy.

If you want load tests to actually run the workflow, temporarily:

- disable economics in config, or
- set budget for the project/tenant, or
- use a bundle that doesn’t enforce economics.

———

## How to confirm script loaded correct tokens

I can add a small print in the script like:

Loaded users: admin=15, registered=15, paid=0

If you want that, I’ll add it.

———

If you’d like, I can also add a flag to skip economics during load testing (e.g. --ignore-econ), so you can load-test without hitting budget limits.


› please in the meanwhile generate 15 test registered users in our /Users/elenaviter/src/kdcube/kdcube-ai-app/app/ai-app/services/kdcube-ai-app/kdcube_ai_app/apps/chat/api/
idp_users.json. i will now simply set the free tier limits to None for the sake of test


• Added 15 registered test users to:

/Users/elenaviter/src/kdcube/kdcube-ai-app/app/ai-app/services/kdcube-ai-app/kdcube_ai_app/apps/chat/api/idp_users.json

It now contains:

- test-admin-token-123
- test-chat-token-456
- test-chat-token-001 … test-chat-token-015

Restart the chat service (or reload SimpleIDP if you have a hot‑reload path), then rerun the load script with --idp-path pointing to that file to guarantee it loads these users.

• Here’s the reality check and a concrete tuning plan.

Current capacity (your config)

- concurrent_per_process=5
                         - processes_per_instance=1
                                                  - capacity_buffer=0.2
                                                                    - queue_depth_multiplier=2

Derived:

- Effective concurrent = 5 * 1 * (1 - 0.2) = 4
                                             - Queue capacity = 5 * 1 * 2 = 10
                                                                            - Total capacity = 14
                                                                                               - Registered blocked at ~0.8 * 14 = 11

So with 40 simultaneous users (15 registered + 15 paid + 10 admin), you will queue immediately and throttle.

———

## What to change (recommended baseline)

Target effective concurrent ≈ 30 to keep wait under ~10–15s for a 25s average turn.

### Option A (balanced, 1 instance)

Use this first; it’s realistic on a dev box with enough CPU:

    Env (must match actual workers):

CHAT_APP_PARALLELISM=5
MAX_CONCURRENT_CHAT=6

Gateway config update:

{
"service_capacity": {
    "concurrent_per_process": 6,
    "processes_per_instance": 5,
    "avg_processing_time_seconds": 25
},
"backpressure": {
    "capacity_buffer": 0.1,
    "queue_depth_multiplier": 3,
    "anonymous_pressure_threshold": 0.6,
    "registered_pressure_threshold": 0.9,
    "hard_limit_threshold": 0.98
},
"rate_limits": {
    "anonymous": { "hourly": 120, "burst": 10, "burst_window": 60 },
    "registered": { "hourly": 2000, "burst": 100, "burst_window": 60 },
    "paid": { "hourly": 4000, "burst": 120, "burst_window": 60 },
    "privileged": { "hourly": -1, "burst": 300, "burst_window": 60 }
}
}

Derived:

- Effective concurrent ≈ 27
                         - Queue capacity = 30 * 3 = 90
                                                     - Total capacity ≈ 117
This should handle your 40 users comfortably.

### Option B (lighter CPU)

If you want fewer processes:

Env

CHAT_APP_PARALLELISM=4
MAX_CONCURRENT_CHAT=6

Backpressure

capacity_buffer=0.1
queue_depth_multiplier=3
registered_pressure_threshold=0.9
hard_limit_threshold=0.98

Effective concurrent ≈ 22. Still OK, but expect some queue wait under a full 40‑user spike.

———

## Critical note

Changing processes_per_instance does nothing unless you actually run that many chat REST processes.

Make sure:

- CHAT_APP_PARALLELISM matches real worker count
                                           - You actually start the service with that many processes
- Monitoring shows healthy_processes ≥ expected

———

## How to validate in Monitoring

Check Capacity Transparency:

    - actual_capacity should reflect real processes
                                          - healthy_processes should match CHAT_APP_PARALLELISM

Queue metrics:

- queue_total should stay < registered threshold
                                       - avg_wait_time should remain reasonable

———

If you want, I can give you a recommended config for your exact machine (CPU/RAM) or help adjust when you tell me the host specs.


› that;s aws machine, can you give me a command which will grab these stats so we know?


• Here’s a single command block you can run on the AWS machine to capture the key stats (CPU, RAM, disk, OS, load) and the EC2 instance type via IMDSv2:

    set -euo pipefail

echo "== OS / Kernel ==" && uname -a && cat /etc/os-release || true
echo

echo "== CPU ==" && lscpu || true
echo

echo "== Memory ==" && free -h || true
echo

echo "== Disk ==" && df -h || true
echo

echo "== Load ==" && uptime || true
echo

echo "== EC2 Instance Type (IMDSv2) =="
TOKEN=$(curl -s -X PUT "http://169.254.169.254/latest/api/token" \
    -H "X-aws-ec2-metadata-token-ttl-seconds: 60") || true
if [ -n "${TOKEN:-}" ]; then
curl -s -H "X-aws-ec2-metadata-token: $TOKEN" \
    http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/instance-type && echo
else
echo "IMDSv2 token fetch failed (IMDS may be disabled)."
fi

If you want a shorter one‑liner (no EC2 metadata):

uname -a; lscpu; free -h; df -h; uptime

Once you paste the output, I’ll translate it into recommended CHAT_APP_PARALLELISM / MAX_CONCURRENT_CHAT and gateway limits.

• Thanks — t3.xlarge (4 vCPU, 16 GiB RAM) is the key. With that, here’s a safe and realistic config for your target load (15 registered + 15 paid + 10 admins = 40 active users),
assuming ~25s avg response time.

———

# Recommended settings (t3.xlarge)

## Process / Concurrency

You have 4 vCPU. Running more than 4 chat REST processes usually hurts (context switching + Python overhead).

Set:

    CHAT_APP_PARALLELISM=4
MAX_CONCURRENT_CHAT=4

This gives 16 concurrent slots total (before buffer).

If you know your average model latency is low (<10s), you can try:

MAX_CONCURRENT_CHAT=5

but start at 4.

———

## Gateway tuning

Update your Gateway config to:

{
    "service_capacity": {
        "concurrent_per_process": 4,
        "processes_per_instance": 4,
        "avg_processing_time_seconds": 25
    },
    "backpressure": {
        "capacity_buffer": 0.1,
        "queue_depth_multiplier": 3,
        "anonymous_pressure_threshold": 0.6,
        "registered_pressure_threshold": 0.9,
        "hard_limit_threshold": 0.98
    },
    "rate_limits": {
        "anonymous": { "hourly": 120, "burst": 10, "burst_window": 60 },
        "registered": { "hourly": 2000, "burst": 100, "burst_window": 60 },
        "paid": { "hourly": 4000, "burst": 120, "burst_window": 60 },
        "privileged": { "hourly": -1, "burst": 300, "burst_window": 60 }
    }
}

### What this gives you

- Effective concurrent: 4 * 4 * (1 - 0.1) = 14
- Queue capacity: 16 * 3 = 48
- Total capacity: 62
- Registered block begins around 0.9 × 62 = 55 queued

That should handle 40 users with manageable waiting, especially if they’re not all submitting at once.

———

# Optional improvements

If you want to be more aggressive:

### Option B (aggressive)

MAX_CONCURRENT_CHAT=5
CHAT_APP_PARALLELISM=4
capacity_buffer=0.1
queue_depth_multiplier=3

Gives:

- Effective concurrent ≈ 18
- Total capacity ≈ 78

But this might overload CPU depending on bundle complexity.

———

# How to confirm on the Monitoring Dashboard

Check Capacity Transparency:

- healthy_processes should equal CHAT_APP_PARALLELISM
- actual_capacity should reflect that

Watch:

- queue_utilization
- avg_wait_time

If queue waits spike quickly, you need either:

- More processes (if CPU allows), or
- Reduced model latency (cache / smaller model / fewer tools)

———

If you want, tell me your model latency (approx) and I’ll give a more precise throughput plan.


› bundle is 95% IO


• Given t3.xlarge (4 vCPU, 16 GiB) and a bundle that’s ~95% IO‑bound, you can safely raise concurrency per process rather than adding more processes.

Here’s a safe starting point that should handle 15 registered + 15 paid + 10 admins:

## 1) Env (must match actual workers)

CHAT_APP_PARALLELISM=4
MAX_CONCURRENT_CHAT=8
MAX_QUEUE_SIZE=200     # optional safety cap; 0 = unlimited

This gives:

- Total concurrent slots = 4 × 8 = 32
- Effective concurrent (with 10% buffer) ≈ 28

That’s enough for 40 active users if they’re not all sending simultaneously.

———

## 2) Gateway config update (match env)

{
    "service_capacity": {
        "concurrent_per_process": 8,
        "processes_per_instance": 4,
        "avg_processing_time_seconds": 25
    },
    "backpressure": {
        "capacity_buffer": 0.1,
        "queue_depth_multiplier": 3,
        "anonymous_pressure_threshold": 0.6,
        "registered_pressure_threshold": 0.9,
        "hard_limit_threshold": 0.98
    },
    "rate_limits": {
        "anonymous": { "hourly": 120, "burst": 10, "burst_window": 60 },
        "registered": { "hourly": 2000, "burst": 100, "burst_window": 60 },
        "paid": { "hourly": 4000, "burst": 150, "burst_window": 60 },
        "privileged": { "hourly": -1, "burst": 300, "burst_window": 60 }
    }
}

Why these changes

- Higher concurrent_per_process leverages IO‑bound nature.
- queue_depth_multiplier=3 gives buffer for short spikes.
    - Higher burst limits avoid UI reload throttling.

———

## 3) If you want to push harder later

Try:

MAX_CONCURRENT_CHAT=10

But only if:

- CPU stays < 70–80%
- avg_wait_time doesn’t spike

———

## 4) What to monitor

In Gateway Monitoring:

- queue_utilization
- avg_wait_time
- healthy_processes (must equal 4)

If avg_wait_time grows quickly, reduce MAX_CONCURRENT_CHAT or increase queue depth.

———

If you want, I can give you a “target config” for lower latency vs higher throughput, depending on your beta goals.


› MAX_CONCURRENT_CHAT is how many concurrent chats are on single worker (since now processor is per worker). CHAT_APP_PARALLELISM unfrotunatelly not considered still. can you help me
now to utilize it (because now my system runs single process web server). i now use 2 ways to run it. on stgaing/prod when i run from dockercompose we use this docker /Users/
elenaviter/src/kdcube/kdcube-ai-app/app/ai-app/deployment/docker/all_in_one_dev/Dockerfile_Chat. and when i develop i run directly from intellij service entrpoint /Users/
elenaviter/src/kdcube/kdcube-ai-app/app/ai-app/services/kdcube-ai-app/kdcube_ai_app/apps/chat/api/web_app.py. but you might notice that MAX_CONCURRENT_CHAT is not considered.
please help me - how can i run - first in developemnt - uvicorn with multiple workers?


• Context compacted

• I wired CHAT_APP_PARALLELISM into the web_app.py entrypoint so running the file directly now launches Uvicorn with multiple workers when the env var is >1. This covers your
IntelliJ/dev run and your Docker CMD ["python", ".../web_app.py"] path.

What changed

- kdcube_ai_app/apps/chat/api/web_app.py now reads CHAT_APP_PARALLELISM and, when >1, starts Uvicorn with workers=N using the import-string target (required by Uvicorn for
multi‑worker).
- Optional UVICORN_RELOAD=1 is supported (but avoid combining reload and multi‑worker for stability).

How to run locally (dev)

1. Multiple workers (no reload):
- CHAT_APP_PARALLELISM=4 UVICORN_RELOAD=0 python -m kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.api.web_app
2. Single worker with reload:
    - CHAT_APP_PARALLELISM=1 UVICORN_RELOAD=1 python -m kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.api.web_app

If you keep using IntelliJ, set env vars in the run config:

- CHAT_APP_PARALLELISM=4
- UVICORN_RELOAD=0

How to run via CLI uvicorn (also works)

uvicorn kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.api.web_app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8010 --workers ${CHAT_APP_PARALLELISM:-1}

Docker
No Dockerfile change needed because you already run python web_app.py. With the update, workers will scale based on CHAT_APP_PARALLELISM in compose/env.

Reminder on capacity math
Total concurrent chat capacity becomes:

- MAX_CONCURRENT_CHAT (per worker) × CHAT_APP_PARALLELISM (workers)

If you want me to update the Dockerfile to use uvicorn directly or to document this in your env docs, I can do that next.

• Updated the docs and sample envs with the new worker behavior and UVICORN_RELOAD support.

Docs updated

- docs/service/environment/service-compose-env-README.md
- docs/service/environment/service-dev-env-README.md

Changes:

- Added UVICORN_RELOAD to tables.
- Expanded CHAT_APP_PARALLELISM description to clarify it controls Uvicorn workers when running web_app.py directly.
- Added a short note in Notes sections.

Sample envs updated (with comments)

- deployment/docker/devenv/sample_env/.env.backend
- deployment/docker/all_in_one_dev/sample_env/.env.backend
- deployment/docker/all_in_one/sample_env/.env.backend

Changes:

- Added comments to CHAT_APP_PARALLELISM explaining worker count and concurrency formula.
- Added UVICORN_RELOAD=0 with a dev‑only comment.

If you want different defaults per env (e.g., UVICORN_RELOAD=1 for local dev only), I can adjust.

• I'm considering adding a Default column with mostly "—" or reused values from compose to the service-dev-env
README table; due to size, I may apply targeted header and row replacements or script simple transformations
while balancing accuracy and scope.

Detailing script approach for default column

I'm planning a python script to insert a Default column with mostly "—" in the dev README table by detecting
table lines and adjusting headers, separators, and rows, then selectively patching known variables with
    concrete defaults to meet requirements while reducing manual errors.

• I'm confirming that default columns were added consistently to optional tables across compose docs and
service-compose env docs, and that the script correctly updated the dev doc's optional table header without
mangling lines.

• Explored
└ Read service-dev-env-README.md

• The script mistakenly inserted a separator in the header line and split rows containing '|' in values,
corrupting column alignment; the header's "Default" column label got replaced by "—" and rows like the
AUTH_PROVIDER one broke due to splitting inside cell content.

Planning table reconstruction using git history

The original dev doc table broke due to unescaped pipes in content, so I'll recover the last committed file
version via git to restore the correct table structure before applying fixes.

• Ran git show HEAD:/Users/elenaviter/src/kdcube/kdcube-ai-app/app/ai-app/docs/service/environment/
│ service-dev-env-README.md
└ fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git

• I confirmed the main folder isn't a git repo but identified a nested git repo inside the kdcube-ai-app
subfolder, so I'll run git commands scoped there using workdir options.

• Ran git -C /Users/elenaviter/src/kdcube/kdcube-ai-app/app/ai-app rev-parse --show-toplevel

`CHAT_APP_PARALLELISM` now controls Uvicorn worker count when you run `web_app.py` directly (IDE/CLI). For
CLI `uvicorn ...`, set `--workers` explicitly or keep this env and use the Python entrypoint.

• I'll reconstruct the dev doc from the original file in HEAD, inserting a default column and fixing pipe
characters in text to prevent broken columns by extracting the original content via git show into a temp
file for processing.

Detailing script steps to transform table with defaults

I'm outlining a script to get the original HEAD file, replace pipe characters in key cells, update headers
and separators for five columns, insert a default column in each row, and then adjust specific default
values before rewriting the file.

• Ran python - <<'PY'
│ from pathlib import Path
│ import subprocess
│ … +69 lines
└ (no output)

• Explored
└ Read service-dev-env-README.md

• The AUTH_PROVIDER row breaks because the pipe character is interpreted as a column separator in the actual
file, not as a substring; the solution is to manually replace the cell text with "Auth provider (simple or
cognito)" rather than trying to replace the nonexistent "simple|cognito" substring.

Planning manual patch for broken table rows and defaults

The WEB_SEARCH_HYBRID_MODE row has the same pipe-splitting issue as AUTH_PROVIDER, requiring manual fixes to
replace pipes with "or" or slashes. Also, replacements for default values of CHAT_APP_PARALLELISM and
UVICORN_RELOAD didn't apply due to mismatched spacing, so I'll patch these lines manually after locating
them with targeted search.

• Explored
└ Search AUTH_PROVIDER|WEB_SEARCH_HYBRID_MODE|CHAT_APP_PARALLELISM|UVICORN_RELOAD in service-dev-env-
README.md

• I'm updating the table rows to align with the new column format, correcting entries for chat app
parallelism, uvicorn reload, auth provider (defaulting to simple), and web search hybrid mode.

• The default column should show "Default" instead of "—" and reflect updated defaults for environment
    variables. Compose doc needs checking for pipe formatting issues similar to dev doc, especially around the
    inserted default column and any simple|cognito text that might break table alignment.

• I confirmed the optional table's header now includes "Default" and accepted the script's removal of
alignment and collapsed spaces. I'm double-checking key rows like AUTH_PROVIDER and WEB_SEARCH_HYBRID_MODE
to ensure the "Default" column updates didn't misalign or incorrectly replace unknown placeholders.

• I see the dev doc uses placeholders for many defaults, while the sample env and compose docs have actual
values or comments; I’m weighing whether to fill more real default values in the dev doc to match, but it
may be a large task.

Planning script to sync dev doc defaults

I mapped a clear approach to parse sample env files and auto-fill the dev doc default column with actual or
    placeholder values for consistency with compose doc; however, given time and scope, I'll keep the current
minimal defaults and placeholders, noting that more comprehensive syncing could be scripted later.

─ Worked for 5m 34s ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

• Added the Default column to both env docs and fixed the two rows that had | inside text (which breaks
tables). Also set explicit defaults for CHAT_APP_PARALLELISM and UVICORN_RELOAD in the dev doc.

Updated

- docs/service/environment/service-compose-env-README.md
- Added Default column
- Fixed AUTH_PROVIDER and WEB_SEARCH_HYBRID_MODE text to avoid |
- docs/service/environment/service-dev-env-README.md
- Added Default column
- Fixed AUTH_PROVIDER and WEB_SEARCH_HYBRID_MODE text
- Set defaults for CHAT_APP_PARALLELISM (4) and UVICORN_RELOAD (0)

If you want the dev doc defaults fully populated from deployment/docker/devenv/sample_env/.env.backend
and .env.frontend, I can auto‑fill them next (right now most are — except the two you asked about).

• Logs suggest uvicorn workers crash after an unhandled exception, but that error is caught at the app level
and shouldn’t kill the process. Worker restarts may stem from reload mode triggered by file changes or temp
files. The 429 rate limit on SSE connections likely results from repeated admin dashboard requests causing
burst rate exhaustion despite registered user limits.

Investigating worker crashes and burst rate limits

The worker deaths likely stem from uvicorn’s multi-worker mode spawning multiple processes that each run
app lifespan and background tasks, which may cause resource conflicts or instability. The 429 burst limits
after one user request might arise from multiple background admin UI calls combined with per-process in-
memory throttling causing inconsistent or inflated request counts across workers.

• Explored
└ Search burst_rate_limit|burst in gateway
Read rate_limiter.py

• The rate limiter blocks per session without endpoint distinction, so multiple background or retry requests from
the same session could trigger the burst limit quickly despite the user reporting only one request. The Uvicorn
worker crashes might relate to unhandled exceptions after the economics limit error, suggesting
agentic_app_func needs better error handling to avoid silent worker deaths.

Investigating worker crash causes beyond economics exceptions

Confirmed that EconomicsLimitException leads to implicit None return without crashing, so worker deaths likely
stem from other errors like asyncio cancellations or SystemExit from Uvicorn. The mysterious "Connected to:"
log lines might come from database connection logs, prompting a code search to locate their source.

• Identified two root issues: 429 errors likely stem from burst rate limiting triggered by repeated SSE polls or
multiple tabs sharing sessions, and Uvicorn workers dying possibly due to worker count mismatches or reload
conflicts despite app settings. Next, I'll confirm these hypotheses by tracing request patterns and worker
configs.

Investigating worker crashes

Suspecting worker deaths stem from lifecycle errors—likely from multiprocessing or concurrency issues after
startup, especially given rapid repeated crashes without clear error logs. Next, I'll inspect processor startup
and Redis queue usage for conflicts under multiple workers.


• Explored
└ Read processor.py

• The logs suggest CHAT_APP_PARALLELISM is effectively 7, likely set alongside MAX_CONCURRENT_CHAT=6, yielding
total capacity 42. Multiple workers each with their own middleware and Redis locks may cause repeated gateway
capacity checks, possibly explaining the concurrency behavior and worker crashes under heavy tasks.

Connecting worker crashes to capacity and rate limiting issues

Worker crashes cause the gateway to overestimate healthy processes, admitting more tasks than can be handled
and leading to queue delays. Frequent worker restarts likely trigger SSE disconnects that cause client retry
loops, producing burst rate limiting 429 errors. Stabilizing uvicorn workers—by disabling reload, reducing
parallelism, and capturing debug logs—is key to resolving these symptoms.

Clarifying causes of 429s and worker restarts with config alignment

Repeated worker crashes cause SSE disconnects and client retries that trigger burst rate limits (429), while
    admin endpoint access by registered users adds request noise. It's important to ensure UVICORN_RELOAD=0 and
align CHAT_APP_PARALLELISM with actual uvicorn workers to prevent capacity mismatches. Adjusting rate limits
for test users and enabling crash logging will help diagnose and stabilize the system.

• Explored
└ Search _process_task in processor.py
Read processor.py

• The worker crash isn't caused by the caught EconomicsLimitException since exceptions there are handled without
crashing. The 429 responses may stem from a mismatch or instability in session_id usage in the gateway's rate
limiter, especially with SSE chat requests using user_session_id separately. Also, some client calls might be
unauthorized, returning 403, which could relate to this. Next, commands to gather deeper root cause info and
adjustments in error handling for rate limits are advisable.

Assessing rate limiter burst configuration

Multiple UI requests plus SSE and background polling could exceed the rate limiter burst, especially if the
registered user burst is around 20 despite recalls of 30 or 60. The actual burst likely comes from Redis-loaded
config overriding defaults, so verifying which profile ("production" vs "development") and its rate limits is
crucial next.

• Explored
└ Read config.py

• The current production profile sets burst to 20, which can be easily exceeded by admin UI requests plus
background calls, explaining 429 errors; increasing the registered burst limit should reduce these rate limit
hits.

Diagnosing worker crashes and rate limit issues

The logs show repeated Uvicorn worker deaths causing SSE disconnects and client retries that, combined with the
    production profile's low burst limit (20), lead to 429 rate limit errors; the configured parallelism appears
applied but real capacity is lower due to unstable workers and possible reload settings.

─ Worked for 3m 40s ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

• Here’s what your log snippet actually shows, and why it looks “weird.” There are two separate issues happening
at the same time.

1) Economics budget failure (expected)

EconomicsLimitException: Project Budget exhausted ...

                                        This is a normal fail-fast path. It does not cause 429s by itself. It just ends the workflow early.

2) Burst rate limiting (429s)

Throttling event: burst_rate_limit for session ... (registered)

Your rate limiter is per session, across all endpoints, using a sliding window in Redis. If the active gateway
profile is “production,” the default for registered is often burst=20 (see infra/gateway/config.py presets).
A single UI load can easily hit that (profile + SSE + conv_status + admin endpoints + retries), especially if:

    - The user has multiple tabs open, or
- The UI is hitting admin dashboards (you see ai_bundles / svc_gateway warnings), or
- SSE is reconnecting repeatedly.

So “only 1 chat request” doesn’t mean “only 1 request.” The session burst counter includes everything.

3) Uvicorn workers are dying

uvicorn.error - INFO - Waiting for child process [PID]
uvicorn.error - INFO - Child process [PID] died

This is not normal. It means the worker process exits repeatedly and the master keeps respawning it. When that
happens:

    - SSE connections are dropped
                          - Clients retry rapidly
                                          - Burst limiter triggers 429s
                                                                      - Gateway still thinks capacity is high (e.g., queue=0/42) because it trusts CHAT_APP_PARALLELISM, not actual
healthy workers

This is the main cause of the “weird” behavior.

———

## Most likely causes of worker deaths

1. UVICORN_RELOAD=1 on a machine where files are constantly changing (logs, bundles, etc.). The reloader keeps
killing workers.
This produces exactly the “child process died” loop.
2. OOM or fatal crash inside the worker (segfault / native lib). This also produces the same loop but without a
traceback.

———

## Quick checks (do these first)

1. Confirm reload is off

echo $UVICORN_RELOAD

If it’s 1, set it to 0 and restart.

2. Confirm worker count matches env

ps -ef | grep -i uvicorn

You should see CHAT_APP_PARALLELISM workers. If they’re dying, you’ll see them cycling.

3. Check for OOM kills

dmesg -T | tail -n 50

Look for “Killed process …”

If you want, I can add a small log line on startup to print UVICORN_RELOAD and CHAT_APP_PARALLELISM so you see
it every boot.

———

## Why 429 happens “after 1 request”

Because the registered user is still generating many requests:

    - UI dashboard calls
                   - SSE connect + conv_status
                         - Auto retries if SSE drops
                                               - Admin endpoints still being called (you see permission warnings)

If your profile is production (burst 20), that’s enough to hit 429.

Fix options:

1. Temporarily increase registered burst (e.g., 100–200) in gateway config for testing.
2. Avoid loading admin dashboards for registered users.
3. Use a privileged user for load testing to avoid burst caps.

———

## What I recommend next

1. Set UVICORN_RELOAD=0 and restart.
2. Run with CHAT_APP_PARALLELISM=1 to confirm stability.
3. If stable, increase workers gradually and watch for “child process died.”
4. Raise registered burst limit in gateway config for the test environment.

If you want, I can also add a monitoring endpoint to show current burst counters per session and actual healthy
workers, so you can see this live.


› but by default UVICORN_RELOAD=0. dev have MAX_CONCURRENT_CHATS=5 CHAT_APP_PARALLELISM=4 and UVICORN_RELOAD
even is not set in theiir env so must default to 0. also why we even do not print with which we run in
web_app.py


• I'm preparing to add startup logs in the web app showing environment variables, computed workers, process IDs,
and reload settings to clarify worker behaviors and crashes. I'll log info both before running uvicorn and
possibly in lifespan startup to ensure per-worker logs surface clearly despite uvicorn's forking and default
reload behavior.

Enhancing startup logs with crash insight

I'll update web_app.py to log detailed startup info including env variables, workers, reload status, and app
target in main, clarifying uvicorn launch context. I’ll also note that worker crashes may not show stack traces
unless debug logging or faulthandler is enabled, suggesting adding faulthandler if useful.

584 +        workers,
585 +        reload_enabled,

587 +        os.getpid(),
588 +    )
589      uvicorn.run(app_target, **run_kwargs)

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

• I agree — with UVICORN_RELOAD unset it should be False, so the worker deaths aren’t from reload. We should log
exactly what the master is doing so it’s visible in every environment.

I added an explicit startup log in web_app.py showing the resolved workers, reload, and target:

    - kdcube_ai_app/apps/chat/api/web_app.py

You’ll now see something like:

Starting Uvicorn: target=kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.api.web_app:app workers=4 reload=False port=8010 pid=12345

So if the teammate still sees workers dying, we can confirm that reload is actually off and the worker count is
                                                                                                       correct.

———

### Next thing to check (if it still dies)

If reload is truly off, the worker deaths are almost always one of:

1. Import-time crash in a worker
                          - It can die before logger is set up.
                                                            - This can happen if something in import path depends on local files that aren’t present or in a bad state.
2. Native crash / OOM
          - Check dmesg -T | tail -n 50 for “Killed process …”.
3. External service failures at startup
- Example: Redis / Postgres connection failing in lifespan and raising before logging.

If you want, I can add a try/except around lifespan startup to log fatal startup errors per worker, and/or
enable faulthandler so crashes show stack traces.

———

Do you want me to add:

1. faulthandler.enable() in __main__, or
2. A defensive try/except around the lifespan startup with logger.exception(...)?


› yes, please log the startup fully and inside the lifespan as well. and make sure we see stack traces


• I'm enhancing startup diagnostics by enabling faulthandler early, logging lifespan start and completion with
process info, and wrapping the entire lifespan startup in a try/except that logs exceptions with tracebacks
before re-raising.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

• Done. I added full startup logging and stack traces in both __main__ and lifespan, plus enabled faulthandler so
native crashes print tracebacks.

Changes

- kdcube_ai_app/apps/chat/api/web_app.py
- faulthandler.enable() in __main__
- Logs at lifespan start/end with PID, port, CHAT_APP_PARALLELISM, UVICORN_RELOAD
    - logger.exception(...) with full tracebacks for gateway init and legacy middleware startup
- If these fail, we now re-raise so the worker crash is visible and not silently swallowed

This should make worker deaths self‑diagnosing. If the workers still die, you should now see why in logs.

If you want, I can also dump environment snapshots and sys.path on startup (useful for import‑time crashes).

• I'm searching the infra/namespaces folder to understand how Redis namespaces and rate limiter keys are
organized and named.

• Explored
└ Search RATE_LIMIT in namespaces.py
Read namespaces.py

• The rate limiter uses keys with session IDs suffixed by burst and hour markers but no root key; resetting
requires deleting all these keys per session with pattern-based deletion for burst and hour keys. Throttling
counters might live elsewhere, but 429 responses come from rate limiter keys stored in sorted sets tied to
sessions.

• Explored

• Backpressure state is managed using Redis, as seen in the backpressure.py file. This suggests a reliance on
Redis for state persistence in handling backpressure.

• Explored
└ Search CAPACITY|BACKPRESSURE|THROTTLING in backpressure.py
Read backpressure.py

• I'm verifying if resetting backpressure involves deleting specific capacity counters and total counters by
checking how CAPACITY_COUNTER_KEY is used around decrement operations, focusing on its role in the atomic
manager class.

• Explored
└ Read backpressure.py

• Backpressure relies on a namespaced total counter key with 300-second expiry, specifically using the :total
suffix; it also uses this key for decrement operations in the atomic manager. I'll verify if other counter
variants exist or if only :total is used.

• Explored
└ Search CAPACITY_COUNTER_KEY in backpressure.py

• The code sometimes uses the bare capacity counter key without the ":total" suffix, revealing inconsistent key
naming that might affect counter handling; next is to clarify and standardize this.

• Explored
└ Read backpressure.py

• There are two capacity keys used inconsistently, but the atomic manager uses the one without :total for
    incrementing and checks. To reset backpressure safely, all relevant capacity counter keys and rate limit keys
    should be deleted. Throttling event keys only track stats and don't enforce limits. Next, I'll check the
    ControlPlaneMonitoringDashboard to see if it offers a built-in reset action.

• Explored
└ Search reset|clear|throttling|rate limit|backpressure in ControlPlaneMonitoringDashboard.tsx

• I'm checking monitoring/monitoring.py for reset-related code to understand which endpoints handle resets beyond
the admin interface's circuit breaker and gateway config reset.

• Explored
└ Search reset in monitoring.py

• No admin UI exists to clear backpressure or rate limits; resetting requires deleting Redis keys. Rate limit
keys use a tenant/project namespace with known prefixes for bursts and hourly counters. Backpressure and queue
stats have separate keys, while circuit breaker states can be reset via admin. Mentioning Redis Browser for
manual key management is appropriate.

Providing detailed Redis key commands

I'm preparing a clear response with example Redis commands to delete per-session rate limit keys and
backpressure counters, emphasizing these affect gating while throttling stats keys only hold metrics. I'll also
note namespace usage and TTLs, and suggest using Redis Browser or redis-cli for key inspection and deletion.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

• Short answer: no, the ControlPlaneMonitoringDashboard doesn’t currently expose a “reset throttling/
backpressure” action. It only resets circuit breakers and gateway config. If you want to clear throttling/
backpressure state, you need to delete Redis keys (via RedisBrowser or redis-cli).

Below are the keys that actually control enforcement, plus the stats-only keys you might want to clear for a
    clean slate.

———

## 1) Rate‑limit (burst/hourly) — enforcement keys

Rate limits are keyed by session id and tenant/project:

Base prefix:

{tenant}:{project}:kdcube:system:ratelimit:{session_id}

Keys to delete:

- ...:burst  (zset, sliding window)
- ...:hour:<hour>  (string counter, per hour)

Example (redis-cli):

prefix="{tenant}:{project}:kdcube:system:ratelimit:{session_id}"
redis-cli DEL "${prefix}:burst"
redis-cli --scan --pattern "${prefix}:hour:*" | xargs redis-cli DEL

———

## 2) Backpressure counters — enforcement keys

These are the counters used by the atomic backpressure logic:

{tenant}:{project}:kdcube:system:capacity:counter
{tenant}:{project}:kdcube:system:capacity:counter:total

Example:

redis-cli DEL "{tenant}:{project}:kdcube:system:capacity:counter"
redis-cli DEL "{tenant}:{project}:kdcube:system:capacity:counter:total"

———

## 3) Throttling stats — metrics only (optional)

These don’t affect enforcement, but clearing them resets the dashboard numbers:

{tenant}:{project}:kdcube:throttling:events
{tenant}:{project}:kdcube:throttling:stats
{tenant}:{project}:kdcube:throttling:session_counters
{tenant}:{project}:kdcube:throttling:total_requests
{tenant}:{project}:kdcube:throttling:requests:hourly
{tenant}:{project}:kdcube:throttling:total_throttled
{tenant}:{project}:kdcube:throttling:rate_limit_429
{tenant}:{project}:kdcube:throttling:backpressure_503
{tenant}:{project}:kdcube:throttling:hourly
{tenant}:{project}:kdcube:throttling:by_reason

———

## Admin UI

- ControlPlaneMonitoringDashboard does not have reset endpoints for these.
    - You can use the Redis Browser app to delete the keys directly.

———

If you want, I can add a “Reset throttling/backpressure” button into the monitoring admin with proper safety
guard and confirmation.

• I'm focusing on adding a backend route in monitoring.py to reset throttling and backpressure keys safely,
scoped by tenant/project and optionally session, guarded by admin authentication before exposing a UI button
calling this endpoint.

• I'm evaluating whether to use auth_without_pressure or require admin roles with RequireRoles for the new
endpoint, noting RequireRoles is imported and used elsewhere; next, I'll review other endpoints using
require_auth to decide the proper authorization setup.

Planning single reset endpoint with scoped options

Determining a single POST endpoint for super-admins accepting a JSON payload to selectively reset session or
all rate limits, backpressure counters, and throttling stats. Decided on safe defaults targeting current
session and tenant, with UI offering distinct buttons for "Reset my session rate limits," "Reset backpressure
counters," and "Clear throttling stats," each calling this endpoint with tailored payloads.

• Decided to obtain tenant and project info via get_settings() in monitoring.py for simplicity and consistency.
Established reset_throttling_stats default to False to avoid unintended stats loss while resetting rate limits
and backpressure by default.

Designing UI reset throttling panel and outlining Redis key deletion

Planning a new "Reset Throttling" card with session ID input and checkboxes for rate limits, backpressure,
stats, and all sessions toggle, defaulting sensibly for ease of use. Also detailing Redis key patterns for
targeted deletions per tenant/project and session or global scopes, ensuring efficient async scan/delete with

Implementing throttle reset with Redis and UI

Planning Redis scan-delete helpers to clear keys by pattern and return deleted counts, plus adding tenant/

• Verified all necessary typing imports are present and the monitoring router is properly integrated without
compile issues; middleware state access should be safe given lifespan setup. Next, I'll finalize the response
about the new endpoint and redis key usage for backpressure reset.

        Finalizing reset functionality details

Confirmed reset behavior targets current or specified sessions with proper tenant/project scoping and global
rate limit impacts; I'll craft a clear response outlining the new API, UI usage, required permissions, and
Redis key reset options.

─ Worked for 2m 32s ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

• Added a reset tool to the Control Plane dashboard, plus the backend endpoint that actually clears the Redis
state.

What’s new

1. Backend endpoint

- POST /admin/throttling/reset (super‑admin only)
- Clears:
    - Rate limits (per session or all sessions)
- Backpressure counters (tenant/project)
               - Throttling stats (tenant/project, optional)

2. Dashboard UI

             - New card: “Reset Throttling / Backpressure”
- Options:
- Session ID (optional; defaults to current session)
- All sessions (danger)
      - Reset rate limits
                   - Reset backpressure counters
                                        - Clear throttling stats

Files changed

      - kdcube_ai_app/apps/chat/api/monitoring/monitoring.py
      - kdcube_ai_app/apps/chat/api/monitoring/ControlPlaneMonitoringDashboard.tsx

How it behaves

       - If you don’t specify Session ID and don’t select “All sessions,” it resets current session’s rate limits.
                                                                                                           - Backpressure counters + throttling stats are always tenant/project scoped.
                                                                                                                                                                                - “All sessions” clears all rate‑limit keys in Redis (global scope), so use with caution.

        No tests run.

If you want the UI to show which session ID is currently in use (from headers or session profile), I can add
that next.


› i hope when you add endpoints you requre admin session in them


• The new reset throttling endpoint requires super-admin via require_auth with RequireRoles, as requested. I
found the circuit breaker reset endpoint uses auth_without_pressure without explicit role checks, which poses a
potential risk; although not explicitly requested, it’s worth flagging or proposing tightening those checks for
consistency.

Confirming admin requirement and offering tightening

The new /admin/throttling/reset endpoint requires a super-admin session via require_auth with RequireRoles. The
circuit breaker reset currently uses auth_without_pressure, which enforces a session but no role check. I can
tighten that if desired—it's in monitoring.py.

• Yes — the new endpoint is super‑admin gated.

I wired /admin/throttling/reset to:

    require_auth(RequireUser(), RequireRoles("kdcube:role:super-admin"))

So it won’t execute without an admin session. Code: kdcube_ai_app/apps/chat/api/monitoring/monitoring.py.

If you want, I can also tighten the existing circuit‑breaker reset endpoint (it currently uses
auth_without_pressure() only).


› auth_without_pressure is super admin who bypass 429 so can reset the breakers if eveyrthing is locked


• Understood — leaving auth_without_pressure() on circuit‑breaker reset makes sense so admins can recover even
when everything is throttled.

The new /admin/throttling/reset endpoint does require super‑admin, so it matches your intent.


› is there anything else which must be available for reset with this way


• The reset endpoint covers throttling/backpressure, but additional states like circuit breaker, gateway config,
session cache, and rate limit keys might also need resets. Queue keys could be optionally cleared to purge
backlog, but that's disruptive; resetting capacity counters may suffice to clear stuck backpressure states.

Detailing comprehensive reset options

I’m outlining all resettable states beyond throttling/backpressure: rate limits, backpressure counters, circuit
breakers, gateway config, session counters, and chat queues for stuck tasks. Clearing queues and analytics keys
is optional and risky but useful for full backlog recovery. I’ll offer these extras with explicit keys and
caution, asking if they should be included in the admin UI.

• Short answer: optional yes, but only if you want a “panic reset.”
Right now the dashboard lets you reset the things that actually cause 429/503:

- Rate‑limit counters (per session or all sessions) ✅
- Backpressure capacity counters ✅
- Circuit breakers ✅
- Gateway config ✅
- Throttling stats (metrics only) ✅

Other possible reset actions (optional, more destructive):

1. Purge chat queues
Keys (namespaced):
- {tenant}:{project}:kdcube:chat:prompt:queue:anonymous
                                              - {tenant}:{project}:kdcube:chat:prompt:queue:registered
                                                                                            - {tenant}:{project}:kdcube:chat:prompt:queue:privileged
This drops pending tasks, so only for emergency.
2. Clear queue analytics (non‑blocking, stats only)
Keys:
    - {tenant}:{project}:kdcube:chat:prompt:queue:analytics:*
3. Economics rate‑limit / budget caches (not gateway throttling)
Keys:
- {tenant}:{project}:kdcube:economics:rl
                                      - {tenant}:{project}:kdcube:economics:plan.balance
This affects budgeting/rate‑limit at the economics layer, not gateway 429/503.

If you want, I can add two more toggles in the dashboard:

- “Purge chat queues” (danger)
                      - “Clear queue analytics”

Tell me which ones you want exposed in the UI.


› 1. (3 is not managed from here). question: why its a danger to reset all sessions rl ?


• Resetting all sessions' rate limits removes protection against burst abuse because rate limiting keys are
global across all tenants, so resetting disables rate limiting system-wide, risking DoS and overload from any
    attacker or buggy client. Also confirming they'll add purge chat queues as option 1, proceeding cautiously with
that feature in endpoint and UI.

Planning purge chat queues implementation

I'll add a purge_chat_queues boolean option to the reset endpoint and UI to clear all chat queues for all user
types including paid, plus clear capacity counters to avoid stale backpressure data. The reset all sessions
rate-limit risk explanation will accompany this, and the endpoint will keep its super admin role restriction.

• Added a new purge chat queues toggle in the UI and endpoint to support user requests. Explained why resetting
all sessions at runtime is risky: it's a global, non-namespaced action that can overload the system, mask
abuse, disrupt monitoring, and impact all tenants if Redis is shared; recommended updating docs disclaimers but
no restart needed.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

• Yes — I added Purge chat queues to the same reset panel and wired it to the backend. It will drop pending tasks
and also clear backpressure counters to avoid stale pressure.

Answer: why “reset all sessions rate‑limit” is dangerous

- The rate‑limit keys are global (not tenant/project namespaced): kdcube:system:ratelimit:{session_id}.
Clearing “all sessions” removes protection for every user on that Redis.
- If any client is misbehaving or reconnecting aggressively, it can flood the system immediately.
- If multiple tenants share Redis, you also lift limits for everyone at once.

If you want, I can make “all sessions” require a second confirmation click or add a “type RESET” guard.


› we need it be tenant project! ohh. can you please just make sure it is tenant project


• I'm planning to update rate limiter code to use tenant/project namespaces by replacing the static prefix with a
dynamic namespace from the ns() method, ensuring all keys include this scoped prefix. I'll search for all uses
of the current REDIS.SYSTEM.RATE_LIMIT to confirm no other parts need updating.

• Explored
└ Search SYSTEM\.RATE_LIMIT in kdcube-ai-app

• I'm planning to switch the rate limiter prefix to namespaced keys using the gateway config for tenant and
project isolation, updating key construction accordingly; the reset endpoint will also use namespaced keys with
optional legacy key cleanup for fairness.

Extending rate limiter and reset to tenant/project scope

I'll fully switch to namespaced keys for rate limiter and reset logic per tenant/project, update the monitoring
dashboard warning to reflect scoped sessions, and ensure session-specific resets remain functional with proper
key patterns.

• Done. Rate‑limit keys are now tenant/project‑namespaced.

                                               Changes

                                               - rate_limiter.py: prefix now uses ns_key(...), so keys are:

{tenant}:{project}:kdcube:system:ratelimit:{session_id}
                                           - monitoring.py: reset endpoint now deletes only tenant/project keys (even with “all sessions”).
- Dashboard warning updated to reflect tenant/project scope.

If you want to clean up old global keys (from before this change), I can add a one‑off “legacy cleanup” toggle
in the reset endpoint.


› is this "tenant-project" is now effective whenever this key even considered? did you check in lua?


• The rate limiter uses a namespaced prefix only in its Redis pipeline calls, not in Lua scripts, which are
solely for backpressure and chat enqueue where keys are already namespaced. Existing old keys remain in Redis
but are unused going forward, and the key for rate limiting isn’t referenced in any Lua scripts. The tenant-
project namespace is effective wherever rate limit keys are used.

Noting base constant usage

The base constant for rate limiting in infra/namespaces.REDIS.SYSTEM.RATE_LIMIT remains unchanged, with
namespacing applied in the rate limiter calls.

• Yes — for rate limiting it’s now fully tenant/project‑scoped.

- The rate‑limit keys are created in RateLimiter.check_and_record() (pipeline operations), not Lua, so the
namespace change is effective immediately.
- Lua scripts are only used for backpressure / chat enqueue. Those keys were already namespaced via ns_key(...)
and remain so.

I also confirmed REDIS.SYSTEM.RATE_LIMIT is now only used via self.ns(...) in rate_limiter.py, and the reset
endpoint uses the same namespaced prefix.

Old global keys will simply be ignored now (but will still exist in Redis until deleted). If you want, I can
add a “cleanup legacy rate‑limit keys” toggle.

› so now "all sessions" its only "all sessions of the selected tenant project"


• Yes. After the change, “All sessions” is scoped to the selected tenant/project only.

Internally the rate‑limit keys are now namespaced like:

{tenant}:{project}:kdcube:system:ratelimit:{session_id}

So the reset uses that prefix and only touches sessions under that tenant/project.

defined with these limits on our server instance?


• Rate limits apply per session ID, with concurrent processing capacity calculated as 5 parallel processes per
instance and 25s average processing time, yielding about 12 requests per minute per instance. Considering
backpressure and queue depth, total effective capacity is 14 requests, setting thresholds for anonymous,
registered, and hard limits accordingly. Given concurrency demands from multiple users exceed concurrency plus
queue capacity, many requests could be rejected, but per-session hourly and burst rate limits at the gateway
control this independently. Burst sizing needs to account for admin UI load spikes and SSE connections, which
may count mainly at connect time.

Proposing rate limit values and capacity formulas

I'm proposing burst limits of 120 for registered, 200 for paid, and 400 for admin sessions, noting rate limits
apply per session ID with concurrency and backpressure independently limiting aggregate load. Using Little’s
Law, the formulas calculate processing capacity, effective capacity after buffer, queue depth, total capacity,
and user thresholds. For their load (15 paid, 15 free, 10 admins), sustaining 40 concurrent requests requires
about 4+ worker processes (20 concurrent requests per instance) to avoid backpressure and 429s. Also
highlighting that current backpressure logic treats paid users like anonymous, meaning paid users hit lower
thresholds, which could cause earlier rejections unless adjusted. Burst sizing should cover UI load spikes and
SSE connects, and admin endpoints may be exempt from rate limiting based on path.

• Yes — rate limits are per session.
The key is now namespaced as:

    {tenant}:{project}:kdcube:system:ratelimit:{session_id}

So burst / hourly apply per session_id (not per user globally, not per tenant). If the same user opens multiple
tabs with the same session, those requests share the same counters.

## How to compute capacity vs. limits (your config)

Given:

    concurrent_per_process = 5
processes_per_instance = 1
avg_processing_time_seconds = 25
capacity_buffer = 0.2
queue_depth_multiplier = 2
anonymous_threshold = 0.6
registered_threshold = 0.8
hard_limit = 0.95

### 1) Processing capacity

concurrent_capacity = concurrent_per_process * processes_per_instance
= 5 * 1 = 5

### 2) Sustainable throughput

throughput ≈ concurrent_capacity / avg_processing_time
= 5 / 25 = 0.2 req/s = 12 req/min

### 3) Effective capacity (after buffer)

effective_capacity = concurrent_capacity * (1 - capacity_buffer)
= 5 * 0.8 = 4

### 4) Queue capacity

queue_capacity = concurrent_capacity * queue_depth_multiplier
= 5 * 2 = 10

### 5) Total capacity (effective + queue)

total_capacity = 4 + 10 = 14

### 6) Thresholds

anonymous_threshold  = floor(14 * 0.6)  = 8
registered_threshold = floor(14 * 0.8)  = 11
hard_limit           = floor(14 * 0.95) = 13

So with your current settings, registered users are blocked when total queued+active >= 11, and hard limit
blocks at 13.

## For 15 paid + 15 free + 10 admins

If all 40 send at once:

    - Only ~4 run immediately
                  - ~10 can queue
                            - The rest will hit backpressure (503)

If they send 1 request per minute each:

- Arrival = 40 req/min
               - Capacity = 12 req/min
→ queue grows indefinitely until backpressure rejects.

### Minimum workers to support 40 req/min

Use Little’s Law:

required_concurrent = arrival_rate * avg_time
arrival_rate = 40 req/min = 0.667 req/s
required_concurrent = 0.667 * 25 = 16.7
workers_needed = ceil(required_concurrent / concurrent_per_process)
= ceil(16.7 / 5) = 4

So 4 workers is the minimum to sustain 40 req/min.
With buffer 0.2, you’ll want 5 workers for headroom.

## Rate limit sizing (per session)

These do not protect overall capacity. They only cap a single session’s burst.

A practical rule:

    - Burst should cover UI burst + SSE connect + retries in 60s.
                                                               - For 5–10 requests on page load:
- registered: 30–60
                 - paid: 60–120
                            - privileged: 200+

                                          Your current values are fine for normal UI bursts. But if you see 429s after one message, it’s usually because:

    1. Multiple tabs share the same session
2. SSE reconnect storms
3. The user hits admin dashboards (many requests)

## Important: Paid users vs backpressure

Today “paid” is treated as “anonymous” in the backpressure Lua script.
That means paid users use the anonymous threshold (lower).
If you want paid to behave like registered or privileged, I can fix that.

———

If you want, tell me:

- average expected requests per user per minute, and
- desired peak burst size,
and I’ll compute a concrete worker count + rate‑limit values for your EC2.


› psid users should not be tteayed as anonymouS!!!


• I'm identifying that paid users are currently treated as anonymous in backpressure logic, so I'll update
AtomicBackpressureManager and related Lua scripts to treat paid users like registered ones, mapping their
thresholds accordingly and adjusting conditions and enums to reflect this.

Identifying user type checks for paid users

I'm mapping paid users to registered in AtomicChatQueueManager's queue scripts and fallback capacity checks,
ensuring backpressure rejection reasons treat paid like registered by updating all UserType.REGISTERED
conditionals accordingly.

• Explored
└ Search UserType\.REGISTERED|registered in backpressure.py

• The plan is to modify threshold logic within BackpressureManager, focusing on areas handling user types,
especially around user_type == UserType.REGISTERED, to address duplicated analytics code also present in atomic
variants.

• Explored
└ Read backpressure.py

• Discovered that thresholds and backpressure checks treat paid users like registered, so the logic and messages
need adjustment. Also found paid queues exist but are excluded from total size calculations and backpressure,
which is a bug; plan to update queue keys and include paid queues in total size and capacity slot Lua script.

Updating backpressure scripts and queue sizing to include paid

Planning to replace the placeholder key in Redis Lua scripts with the paid queue key and update key counts
accordingly, fixing the omission of paid in total queue size calculations. Will also add paid to individual
queue size retrieval and backpressure checks to ensure accurate pressure and admission control, grouping paid
with registered for thresholds but including paid queue size everywhere to fix undercounting.

• Explored
└ Search get_individual_queue_sizes|QUEUE_ANALYTICS|individual_queues in backpressure.py

• Both versions of the class must be updated; the second one appears near the second get_individual_queue_sizes
method around line 806.

• Explored
└ Read backpressure.py

• Planning to update multiple BackpressureManager methods to include "paid" user_type, treating it like
"registered" for capacity checks and analytics. This involves extending queue size calculations, analytics
reporting, Lua scripts for atomic checks, and threshold logic to correctly handle "paid" users.

Extending atomic scripts and stats for paid users

Planning to update AtomicChatQueueManager's enqueue script and call to include paid queues like registered, and
extend AtomicBackpressureManager queue stats to incorporate paid. Noting QueueStats dataclass may lack a paid
field, so paid might not display separately despite being counted in totals.

• Explored
└ Search class QueueStats in definitions.py
Read definitions.py

• Adding a paid queue size to the total sum seems safe since key-specific accesses remain unchanged, but
including "paid" in the queue sizes dictionary requires caution to avoid breaking analytics or metric code that
may expect only certain keys. Next, I'll verify how analytics handle unexpected user types to ensure
robustness.

Planning Lua script updates for paid queue

Paid queue analytics will store separately but won’t appear in UI metrics lists, which is acceptable. To
enforce backpressure correctly, I'll update total size computations and Lua scripts to include the paid queue
key, ensuring key counts remain consistent to avoid breaking Redis eval calls. Next, I’ll inspect atomic
backpressure manager’s eval usage for required adjustments.

                                             adjusting function args to handle six keys including the paid queue key, and updating conditions to include
                                             paid alongside registered.

                                             ensuring paid is treated like registered in capacity checks and thresholds. Analytics loops in atomic managers
                                             will include paid, affecting total queue sizes but without UI changes for paid-specific stats.

• Paid user queue sizes are included properly in total size calculations and analytics updates, with no
unintended treatment as anonymous; UI excludes paid from display as expected. The backpressure logic and
acceptance checks accommodate paid without conflict, confirming consistency across components.

Confirming backpressure updates include paid users

Backpressure logic consistently treats paid users like registered ones across atomic, non-atomic, and chat
enqueue checks, with total queue size including paid. No test updates needed, and existing rate limiter keys
remain unaffected as expected. Preparing to finalize response summarizing these changes.

─ Worked for 2m 53s ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

• Fixed. Paid users are now treated as registered in backpressure checks, and paid queue length is included in
total pressure. This applies to:

    - Gateway immediate backpressure (atomic capacity check)
- Chat enqueue backpressure (atomic Lua)
- Fallback/non‑atomic checks
                      - Queue analytics counts (paid is now tracked)

Key changes in kdcube_ai_app/infra/gateway/backpressure.py:

- Paid → uses registered thresholds (not anonymous).
                         - Total queue size now includes paid queue.
                                                              - Lua scripts updated accordingly.

This means paid users no longer hit anonymous thresholds and will be admitted like registered users.

If you want “paid” to have its own threshold, we can extend the config to support a paid threshold and wire it
through.

Identifying threshold handling gaps for paid users

The current backpressure code treats paid users like registered with shared thresholds and messages, so I'll

support in atomic queue management Lua scripts, adjust queue order processing, and prepare UI config support
and tests for paid threshold customization.

• Evaluating whether to introduce a new PAID_BACKPRESSURE enum to distinguish paid user throttling separately

broader code updates.

Confirming feasibility of adding paid backpressure reason

Deciding to add a new PAID_BACKPRESSURE reason for clearer logging and UI display, as existing stats handle new
keys dynamically and UI shows raw reason text; next steps include searching code for explicit enum uses to
ensure compatibility.

• Explored
└ Search REGISTERED_BACKPRESSURE|ANONYMOUS_BACKPRESSURE|SYSTEM_BACKPRESSURE|ThrottlingReason in kdcube_ai_app

• Adding a new PAID_BACKPRESSURE reason is safe and more precise for UI differentiation, though it requires
minimal UI handling; existing gating logic can remain unchanged since it treats both backpressure types
similarly.

Preparing throttling logic updates

limiter needs review to confirm it applies paid thresholds correctly and respects user type mapping as the user
expects.

• I'm preparing to revise threshold checks in backpressure.py to use explicit PAID_BACKPRESSURE and
ANONYMOUS_BACKPRESSURE reasons, aligning messages with user types and clarifying distinctions between paid,
registered, and anonymous thresholds.

Aligning backpressure reason handling across methods

I'm noting some inconsistency in using SYSTEM versus ANONYMOUS_BACKPRESSURE for anonymous thresholds but will
keep current approach to avoid scope creep. Next, I'll update multiple methods to handle the PAID_BACKPRESSURE
reason properly and fix related issues like duplicate keys and queue stats, applying these changes through a
multi-hunk patch.

Outlining detailed user response

I'm preparing a clear, GitHub-flavored Markdown reply explaining that the paid field in the config snippet
relates to rate limits, while backpressure now has separate paid_pressure_threshold support exposed in Control
Plane Monitoring's config and UI. I'll clarify queue order remains independent of backpressure gating. The
response will list key changed files, note tests weren't run, and advise on live config updates via the UI
without needing restarts.

─ Worked for 11m 09s ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

• Short answer: the paid you’re seeing in that JSON is rate‑limits, not backpressure thresholds. Until now
backpressure treated paid the same as registered. I’ve wired paid as its own backpressure tier and exposed it
in the monitoring UI so you can configure it.

What I changed

- Backpressure now has a dedicated paid_pressure_threshold and uses it in both gateway checks and enqueue Lua.
(kdcube_ai_app/infra/gateway/backpressure.py)
- Added PAID_BACKPRESSURE reason for accurate throttling events. (kdcube_ai_app/infra/gateway/thorttling.py)
- Gateway status now includes paid queue + accepting_paid + paid_threshold. (kdcube_ai_app/infra/gateway/
                                                                             gateway.py)
- Monitoring API and dashboard now surface paid queue, analytics, and thresholds, and the config JSON includes
paid_pressure_threshold. (kdcube_ai_app/apps/chat/api/monitoring/monitoring.py, kdcube_ai_app/apps/chat/api/
                          monitoring/ControlPlaneMonitoringDashboard.tsx)
- Monitoring cheat sheet updated to mention paid queues. (docs/service/maintenance/requests-monitoring-
                                                          README.md)

How to configure from UI

- Open Control Plane Monitoring → Gateway Configuration JSON.
- Set:
- backpressure.paid_pressure_threshold (ratio 0–1).
- It is validated so registered <= paid < hard_limit.
- Click Update; no restart required.

Note on QUEUE_ORDER

- QUEUE_ORDER = ("privileged", "registered", "anonymous", "paid") in processor.py controls processing order
only.
- Backpressure is admission gating in the gateway. With this change, paid users are admitted up to their own
threshold even if registered is blocked.

Tests not run. If you want, I can also add a small UI callout next to the queue cards that shows the active
paid threshold value.


› Also regarding this
concurrent_per_process = 5
processes_per_instance = 1
avg_processing_time_seconds = 25
capacity_buffer = 0.2
queue_depth_multiplier = 2
anonymous_threshold = 0.6
registered_threshold = 0.8
hard_limit = 0.95

Now because we create the processor per worker, number of running processes ("processes per instance") =
CHAT_APP_PARALLELISM.
We can have another ENV var (additional) for this processes_per_instance (soon we will move processor to its
own service)
but for now let's compute processes_per_instance to be CHAT_PROC_PARALLELISM or CHAT_APP_PARALLELISM or 1
then concurrent_per_process must be MAX_CONCURRENT_CHATS (maybe its already it)
This is anyway per instance and must be read from env because this exact env influences actual services
provision

And yes, we share session per tab. user_id is equivalent to session_id (just session id is not so long lived)
So we should consider users might have up to 10 opened tabs (regardless the role). and consider this burst is
OK. and consider that on load it might be 10-15 request on load (its not but just suppose it is)

Also can we in Gateway admin console to help to configure the configuration based on:
- num of requests at the page load
- num of max tabs opened for same session (regardless of the role)
- machine CPU / memory
- and users simultaneously expected:
N admins
M registered (free)
K paid


• I'm preparing to update the config to compute processes_per_instance from CHAT_PROC_PARALLELISM or
CHAT_APP_PARALLELISM with a default of 1, and to set concurrency per process from MAX_CONCURRENT_CHATS. I’ll
propose implementing a quick capacity calculator widget in the Gateway admin console to help users configure
these settings. Next, I’ll locate and modify the ServiceCapacitySettings config, especially its post_init and
create_from_env methods, to handle these environment variables properly.

• Planning to add new state variables for capacity planning in the UI with initial defaults set, including
admins, registered, paid users, page load, tabs, window, and safety factor; will compute concurrent per process
from config and allow editing for simulation.

Planning initial state sync with config

Deciding to initialize planner state from system config only once using a ref to avoid overwriting user edits,
syncing on system changes through useEffect. Next, checking the Input component to align controlled input
handling with string state values.

• I'm updating system monitoring and gateway config views to include new queue and pressure threshold fields,
aligning with backend usage and env var changes; environment docs update is noted but deferred for now.

Validating and integrating paid pressure threshold

I'm updating gateway config validation to fully support paid_pressure_threshold consistently, ensuring
backpressure settings and queue stats reflect it correctly; concurrency env vars are integrated with
explanations for rate limiting and session tab bursts. I'm preparing a response summarizing these changes and
noting env docs update as optional but recommended.

• Explored
└ Search QueueStats\( in kdcube_ai_app

• I've integrated paid into gateway.get_system_status and ensured queue_stats.total still calculates correctly.
The UI can handle missing paid in queue analytics without errors. I noticed we need to update the atomic
enqueue script call argument order to include paid_threshold and will adjust the control plane monitoring
defaults accordingly. Also, I'll add paid_pressure_threshold to the frontend gateway config extraction for
backpressure settings, considering the alias handling in validation as a minor optional improvement.

Extending config types and finalizing capacity planning guidance

I've added backpressure_settings to the system monitoring response type and updated the gateway config view
with service capacity fields. The environment now resolves processes_per_instance and concurrency per process
from aliased variables, supporting capacity planning in the UI. I'll provide formulas and practical guidance on
rate limits, burst sizing, and concurrency considering multi-tab usage and request bursts, clarifying how paid
backpressure thresholds differ from rate limits. This lays out a comprehensive response covering code changes,
usage, and tuning advice.

─ Worked for 4m 04s ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

• Got it. I made the config/env changes and added a “Capacity Planner (Rough)” panel in the Gateway admin console
so you can plug in page‑load requests, max tabs, and expected user counts. It computes a per‑session burst
minimum and compares peak RPS vs estimated capacity.

Code changes

1. Processes per instance now resolves as:
- CHAT_PROC_PARALLELISM → CHAT_APP_PARALLELISM → 1
2. Concurrent per process now resolves as:
- MAX_CONCURRENT_CHATS → MAX_CONCURRENT_CHAT → 5
3. Debug env endpoint includes the new env names.
4. Gateway admin console now has a Capacity Planner card (no backend changes needed).

## How to think about limits with shared sessions

Rate limits are per session (and your session is shared across tabs).
So if a user can open up to T tabs and each page load fires R requests:

Minimum burst per session

burst_min = R * T
suggested_burst = ceil(burst_min * safety_factor)

With your numbers:

- R = 10–15
- T = 10
- burst_min = 100–150
- Use a safety factor 1.2 → 120–180

That is per session, so you set it per role in rate_limits:

- registered burst ≥ 120–180
- paid burst ≥ same or higher
- privileged higher if admins reload often

———

## Capacity math you should keep in mind

From gateway config:

concurrent_per_process = MAX_CONCURRENT_CHAT(S)
processes_per_instance = CHAT_PROC_PARALLELISM or CHAT_APP_PARALLELISM
total_concurrent_per_instance = concurrent_per_process * processes_per_instance
effective_concurrent = total_concurrent_per_instance * (1 - capacity_buffer)
queue_capacity = total_concurrent_per_instance * queue_depth_multiplier
total_capacity = effective_concurrent + queue_capacity

Throughput (rough):

max_rps ≈ total_concurrent / avg_processing_time_seconds

This is what the planner compares to your page‑load surge RPS:

peak_rps = (R * total_users) / page_load_window_seconds

———

## New: Capacity Planner in the Gateway console

In Control Plane Monitoring you now have a Capacity Planner (Rough) card:

- Inputs:
- Admins, Registered, Paid
- Page-load requests
- Max tabs/session
- Page-load window
- Safety factor
- Concurrent / process
- Processes / instance
- Instances
- Avg processing (s)
- Outputs:
- Burst/session (min)
- Suggested burst
- Peak RPS vs Max RPS
- Peak utilization

This is a quick sanity check for whether your expected load will swamp the instance, and what burst limit to
set per role.

———

## Answering your “paid in gateway config” question

The paid shown in the gateway config you pasted is the rate‑limit tier (per‑session 429s).
Backpressure thresholds are separate and now include paid_pressure_threshold (so paid doesn’t get blocked at
the registered threshold).

———

## Next step if you want

I can also add role‑specific recommended burst outputs (e.g., paid/admin multipliers) and optionally auto‑fill
the JSON config with those numbers as a “draft”.

If you want that, tell me:

1. Safety factor you want (1.2? 1.5?)
2. Page‑load window default (10s? 15s?)

I didn’t touch env docs yet for the new aliases—tell me if you want them updated now.


› 1.5. page load 10s. also i need to you in this caluclator to give me this recommended json - yes. but not in
the same view as Gateway Configuration (whcih is effective configuration). also in gateway config i see
"service_capacity": {
    "concurrent_per_process": 5,
    "processes_per_instance": 1,
    "avg_processing_time_seconds": 25
},  i thought we already derive the processes_per_instance from CHAT_PROC_PARALLELISM or
CHAT_APP_PARALLELISM or 1 and i see concurrent_per_process seems not derived from MAX_CONCURRENT_CHATS or 5 ?


• I found that UI config shows default env values because if env vars aren't set, defaults like 5/1 are used and
displayed from capacity transparency config. Gateway Configuration reflects these configured values applied at
startup, requiring a backend restart to update. I'll explain this difference in the UI and implement a separate
recommended JSON panel that computes new burst limits and includes rate_limits with recommended bursts and
perhaps hourly data.

Designing recommended JSON with role bursts

I'm defining recommended per-session burst based on page load, tabs, and safety factor 1.5, applying the same
burst to all roles by default. The JSON will include service capacity from planner inputs, preserve existing
backpressure settings, and keep hourly limits from current config. I'll add a separate UI panel with a read-
only JSON textarea labeled as a draft for copying into Gateway Configuration. I'll also update planner defaults
and clarify env variable visibility and restart needs for config updates.

• Gateway config values derive from environment variables at backend startup, defaulting to 5 and 1 if unset.
Panel values come from capacity transparency config; if env vars change but defaults persist, check GET /debug/
                                                                                                    environment and GATEWAY_CONFIG_JSON overrides, then restart. Aliases like MAX_CONCURRENT_CHATS and
                                                                                                                                                                              CHAT_PROC_PARALLELISM were added, and process count from env is still read during config creation, affecting
uvicorn worker behavior.

Summarizing env updates and recommended config

The updated environment variables now read concurrency and process counts from new aliases like
CHAT_PROC_PARALLELISM and MAX_CONCURRENT_CHATS; if defaults 5/1 appear, env vars aren’t set or overridden—
verify via /debug/environment and GATEWAY_CONFIG_JSON, then restart. The recommended JSON uses the same burst
limits for registered and paid users, with privileged users capped at the max of current or recommended; the
default safety factor is now 1.5 with a 10-second window. Multiple uvicorn workers each run their own
processes, so parallelism settings should align accordingly.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

• Done. I updated the planner defaults (safety = 1.5, window = 10s) and added a separate “Recommended Config
Draft” card that outputs JSON (not in the Gateway Configuration panel). It keeps hourly limits from current
config, updates burst/burst_window per the planner, and mirrors the planner’s service‑capacity values.

Where it is

- ControlPlaneMonitoringDashboard.tsx now has:
    - Capacity Planner (Rough)
               - Recommended Config Draft (read‑only JSON you can copy into Gateway Configuration if desired)

———

## Why you still see concurrent_per_process=5, processes_per_instance=1

Those values are effective runtime config. If env isn’t present in the backend process, defaults are used.

I added the env aliases as requested:

- processes_per_instance = CHAT_PROC_PARALLELISM → CHAT_APP_PARALLELISM → 1
                                                                          - concurrent_per_process = MAX_CONCURRENT_CHATS → MAX_CONCURRENT_CHAT → 5

So if you still see 5/1, it means env not set in that backend process or overridden by GATEWAY_CONFIG_JSON, or
you didn’t restart.

Quick check
Hit:

GET /debug/environment

It now prints:

- MAX_CONCURRENT_CHAT, MAX_CONCURRENT_CHATS
                       - CHAT_PROC_PARALLELISM, CHAT_APP_PARALLELISM

If these are empty/default → the process didn’t receive envs.
If set but UI still shows old → restart backend (gateway config is computed at startup).

———

## How the recommended JSON is computed

From the planner inputs:

- burst_per_session = page_load_requests * max_tabs
                      - suggested_burst = ceil(burst_per_session * safety_factor)

The JSON uses:

- registered burst = suggested burst
                               - paid burst = suggested burst
                                                        - privileged burst = max(suggested_burst, current_privileged_burst)
                                                                             - anonymous burst stays as current config

If you want custom multipliers (e.g., paid ×1.2, admin ×1.5), say the numbers and I’ll wire them in.

If you want, I can also:

1. Add role‑specific multipliers for the recommended JSON (paid/admin).
2. Add a “copy to clipboard” button for the draft.
3. Push these env updates into the env docs + sample .env files.

• The repeated worker deaths likely stem from child process crashes at startup, possibly due to PyCharm debugger
issues with multiple Uvicorn workers; I'll ask for child stderr logs and recommend setting UVICORN_WORKERS=1
with reload off and debug logging to surface the root cause.

Investigating config profile mismatch

There’s a contradictory profile log showing development but a summary stating production, likely from
environment variables or config JSON overrides; I'll inspect the resolver code to see if config is constructed
then overwritten, possibly due to concurrency.

• Explored
└ Search Gateway Configuration Summary|Creating gateway configuration in resolvers.py
Read resolvers.py

• The log shows "development" from the environment variable, but the final config uses "production" from a JSON
config that overrides the env var profile. This explains the apparent inconsistency; next, I'll investigate if
the large JSON in the env (possibly from PyCharm config) causes the uvicorn child process to die.

Diagnosing child worker crashes with multiprocess uvicorn

Child processes likely crash silently due to multiprocess issues under PyCharm’s debugger, possibly from import
errors or signals during worker startup. Setting workers to 1 or increasing logging/debug flags can reveal the
root cause and avoid forking-related failures.

• Explored
└ Search uvicorn|workers in web_app.py
Read web_app.py

• I'm planning to unify workers calculation in web_app to use the same environment-based concurrency logic from
config, specifically prioritizing CHAT_PROC_PARALLELISM then CHAT_APP_PARALLELISM with fallback to 1, and
ensure concurrency per process reflects MAX_CONCURRENT_CHATS. I'll also add startup logging for these values
and verify the gateway config exposes consistent concurrency info for the UI.

Finding config mismatch causing concurrency confusion

The concurrency discrepancy comes from GATEWAY_CONFIG_JSON overriding processes_per_instance to 1 despite
uvicorn running 4 workers, explaining the low concurrency reported. The env var might be set in PyCharm and
ignored by child workers or conflicting with CHAT_APP_PARALLELISM, so I'll suggest logging the gateway config
source and values at startup to clarify which settings apply.

Diagnosing worker crashes under PyCharm debug

Worker crashes likely stem from running multiple uvicorn workers under PyCharm debugging, which complicates
multiprocessing and debug socket connections. I'll recommend running with a single worker during dev and
separating env vars for uvicorn workers and processor concurrency to avoid conflicts and investigate
potentially failing startup tasks or resource contention in each worker.

• Considering separate worker env vars (1m 31s • esc to interrupt)
