Author slide-structured HTML that renders cleanly to PPTX.
- CRITICAL: Wrap all content in <section> tags - one section per slide. Content outside sections won't render.
- Use <h1> for slide title, <h2>/<h3> for section headings within slides.
- Keep content within slide budgets to avoid auto-scaling.
- Use supported CSS only; include citations with <sup class="cite">.
