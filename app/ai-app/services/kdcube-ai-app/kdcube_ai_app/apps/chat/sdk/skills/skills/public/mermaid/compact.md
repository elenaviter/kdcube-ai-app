Write syntactically correct Mermaid diagrams that render without errors.
- ALWAYS quote labels containing: spaces, parentheses, periods, colons, commas, or special chars.
- Use double quotes: A["Label with (special) chars"] not A[Label with (special) chars].
- When in doubt, quote everything - overquoting is safe, underquoting breaks rendering.
