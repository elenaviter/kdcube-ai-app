[AVAILABLE COMMON TOOLS]
Available tools extend agent capabilities with specific operations. Call tools using their full ID (e.g., generic_tools.web_search).

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

🔧 [1] io_tools.tool_call [async]

   Execute a tool function and persist the call payload to OUTPUT_DIR as
   JSON (indexing the filename per tool). Returns the tool's raw result.
   Mandatory to use from generated code (and ONLY from generated code) to
   invoke any catalog tool. Never should be called as a tool from
   tool-calling agents.

   📥 Parameters:
       • fn: object
         Callable tool to invoke (e.g., generic_tools.web_search).
       • params: any (default={})
       • call_reason: ['string'
         'null'], Short human reason for the call (5–12 words).
       • tool_id: ['string'
         'null'], Qualified id like 'generic_tools.web_search'. If omitted,
         derived from fn.__module__+'.'+fn.__name__.
       • filename: ['string'
         'null'], Override filename for the saved JSON (relative in
         OUTPUT_DIR).

   📤 Returns:
       object — Raw return from the tool

   📞 Usage: io_tools.tool_call(...)

🔧 [2] ctx_tools.fetch_ctx [async]

   Fetch a single artifact from context.json by dot-path. Return shape is
   ALWAYS a dict: {"ret": <value|null>, "err":
   <null|{code,message,details?}>} USAGE RESTRICTION (HARD) - This tool may
   ONLY be used by a code generation agent (the generator writing the code).
   - Do NOT call this tool directly from planning/decision roles unless you
   are authoring code. IMPORTANT NAMESPACES • All entities are artifacts
   (user prompt, assistant completion, attachments, tool results, slots). •
   Slots are contract deliverables for a turn (final outputs). Paths:
   <turn_id>.slots... • Tool artifacts are intermediate artifacts produced
   by tool calls in the CURRENT TURN ONLY. Paths: current_turn.artifacts...
   PATH FORMAT • Root: <turn_id> or current_turn -> returns turn view
   {turn_id,user,assistant,slots,artifacts} • Artifacts (ALL entities): -
   <turn_id>.user.prompt - <turn_id>.assistant.completion -
   <turn_id>.user.attachments.<artifact_name> -
   current_turn.artifacts.<artifact_id> - <turn_id>.slots.<artifact_name>
   You may append a leaf (.text/.summary/.mime/...) where applicable. •
   Messages (compat aliases): <turn_id>.user | <turn_id>.assistant |
   current_turn.user | current_turn.assistant Forgiving behavior: if the
   agent accidentally appends segments (e.g. turn_12.assistant.whatever),
   the tool will ignore extra segments and treat it as turn_12.assistant. •
   Slots (deliverables): <turn_id>.slots | <turn_id>.slots.<slot> |
   <turn_id>.slots.<slot>.<leaf> Allowed slot leaves: name, type,
   description, summary, gaps, draft, sources_used, text, format, path,
   mime, filename, . Hard rule: Slots NEVER allow '.value' ('.value' or
   '.value.*' is an error). Forgiving behavior: if extra segments appear
   after a valid slot leaf, they are ignored. • Tool results (CURRENT TURN
   ONLY): current_turn.artifacts | current_turn.artifacts.<artifact_id> |
   current_turn.artifacts.<artifact_id>.<leaf> |
   current_turn.artifacts.<artifact_id>.value.<subkeys> Common tool_result
   leaves: tool_id, value, summary, sources_used, timestamp, inputs,
   call_record, artifact_type, content_lineage, error Structured traversal
   rule: The high-level shape of the value reflects the shape of the tool
   return value which produced it You may traverse inside tool_result.value
   using dotted keys. If value is a JSON string, it is auto-parsed to allow
   traversal. If you fetch the enclosing object, you will have to manage the
   traversal on your own HARD RULES • 'literal:' anywhere in path => error •
   turn_id normalization: - accepts shorthand without 'turn_' if it exists
   (e.g. '12' -> 'turn_12' if present) - accepts the canonical current turn
   id (e.g. 'turn_999') and normalizes it to 'current_turn' • historical
   '<turn_id>.artifacts.*' is not stored. Forgiving behavior: historical
   artifacts paths are rewritten to 'current_turn.artifacts.*'. • invalid
   slot leaf => error WHAT YOU RECEIVE (TYPICAL TURN VIEW) When you call
   with a ROOT path (just <turn_id> or 'current_turn'), you receive: {
   "turn_id": "turn_123" | "current_turn", "user": <string|dict|null>,
   "assistant": <string|dict|null>, "slots": { "<slot_name>": <slot_object>,
   ... }, "artifacts": { "<artifact_id>": <tool_result_object>, ... } }
   Notes: • For historical turns: artifacts is always {} (not stored
   historically). • For current_turn: artifacts can be non-empty. CANONICAL
   ARTIFACT SHAPE (ALL ENTITIES) { "artifact_name": "...", "artifact_tag":
   "chat:user"|"chat:assistant"|"artifact:user.attachment"|"artifact:assistan
   t.file"|..., "artifact_kind": "inline"|"file", "artifact_type"?: "...", #
   optional human-readable type "format"?: "markdown"|"json"|"html"|..., #
   for inline "mime"?: "text/plain"|"application/pdf"|..., # for file
   "summary"?: "...", # semantic/structural summary (shown in journal)
   "sources_used"?: [sid, sid, ...] # payload fields:
   text/base64/path/filename/hosted_uri/rn/etc. } Common payload fields: -
   text: inline content (prompt/completion/inline artifacts) - base64:
   binary payload for attachments (if available) - summary:
   semantic/structural summary of content - artifact_type: optional
   human-readable type hint TYPICAL SLOT OBJECT SHAPE (in
   turn_view.slots[slot_name]) Slots are produced by solver mapping and look
   like one of these: INLINE SLOT: { "type": "inline", "format":
   "text"|"markdown"|"json"|..., "text": "...", # authoritative text
   representation "description": "...", "sources_used": [sid, sid, ...],
   "summary"?: "...", "gaps"?: "...", "draft"?: true } FILE SLOT: { "type":
   "file", "mime": "application/pdf"|"text/plain"|..., "path": "...", #
   output path (often OUTPUT_DIR-relative) "filename"?: "...", "text":
   "...", # authoritative surrogate text "description": "...",
   "sources_used": [sid, sid, ...], "summary"?: "...", "gaps"?: "...",
   "draft"?: true } TYPICAL TOOL RESULT OBJECT SHAPE (in
   current_turn.artifacts[artifact_id]) { "tool_id": "...", "value": <any -
   the shape defined by tool produced it, any nested shape will be clear
   from playbook>, "summary": "...", "sources_used": [sid, sid, ...],
   "timestamp": <float>, "inputs": { ... }, "call_record": {"rel":...,
   "abs":...}, "artifact_type": "..."|null, "content_lineage"?:
   ["current_turn.artifacts.X", ...], "error"?: { ... } } HOW TO OPERATE 1)
   If you want to borwse the turn view in code, you can fetch entire turn: •
   fetch_ctx("current_turn") • fetch_ctx("turn_123") 2) To retrieve the
   individual slots (deliverables) or their attributes: •
   fetch_ctx("turn_123.slots") • fetch_ctx("turn_123.slots.report_md") •
   fetch_ctx("turn_123.slots.report_md.text") 3) For current-turn
   intermediate artifacts and their results. Usually you are interested in
   tool result <artifact_id>.value.content for non-file results and
   <artifact_id>.value.text for files (might contain surrogate text) for
   deep content connection or <artifact_id>.summary for structural /
   semantic summary of the result content: •
   fetch_ctx("current_turn.artifacts") •
   fetch_ctx("current_turn.artifacts.web_1") •
   fetch_ctx("current_turn.artifacts.web_1.value.content") 4) Use messages
   if you need what the user/assistant said: • fetch_ctx("turn_123.user") •
   fetch_ctx("turn_123.assistant") ERRORS If something cannot be resolved,
   err is non-null, e.g.: { "ret": null, "err": {"code": "not_found",
   "message": "Path not found", "details": {"normalized_path": "..."}} }
   WHEN TO USE • After reading the program playbook, when you need to re-use
   artifacts. • When you know (or suspect) a turn_id / slot name /
   tool_result id and want to inspect it or connect this data to your flow.

   📥 Parameters:
       • path: string
         Dot-path to an existing artifact, or a <turn_id> root.

   📤 Returns:
       object — dict: {ret, err}. Dict. Not a JSON string!

🔧 [3] llm_tools.generate_content_llm [async]

   Generate HTML/Markdown/JSON/YAML (or plain text) with multi-round
   continuation and format/schema validation. Supports multimodal inputs via
   `sources_list`. INPUT CHANNELS (SELF-CONTAINED): - instruction: custom
   guidance and constraints for what to produce. - input_context: short
   human-scale context or prior drafts (not raw sources). - sources_list:
   structured sources for citations and evidence; may include multimodal
   items (mime+base64). - skills: optional skill refs to inject full skill
   instructions into the system prompt (e.g., SK1 or
   skills.public.pdf-press). BEHAVIOR: - If `schema_json` is provided (JSON
   Schema) AND target_format is json|yaml, the schema is INCLUDED in the
   prompt and the model is REQUIRED to conform; output is validated
   post-hoc. - If `cite_sources=true` and `sources_list` is non-empty, the
   model MUST use citations: • inline [[S:n]] for Markdown/HTML, • sidecar
   at the default /_citations path for JSON/YAML and managed_json_artifact.
   - The result envelope ALWAYS includes `sources_used` (list of SIDs), even
   if the content itself has no inline tokens. Downstream code must persist
   this list into the target slot as `sources_used`. TOKEN BUDGET POLICY
   (MANDATORY — READ BEFORE SETTING max_tokens): - `max_tokens` is a HARD
   SAFETY CAP, NOT a cost-optimization knob. - Billing is based on tokens
   ACTUALLY GENERATED; unused headroom is NOT billed. - Setting `max_tokens`
   "low to save money" usually BACKFIRES: truncated/invalid
   HTML/JSON/XML/YAML => validation fails => repair/retry rounds => MORE
   total tokens and latency. - Therefore: setting `max_tokens` too low is
   considered a correctness bug. STRUCTURED OUTPUTS REQUIRE HEADROOM (avoid
   retries): - HTML/XML are the most fragile. Do NOT set low caps. - Note:
   the runtime may silently FLOOR some formats (e.g. HTML) to a minimum;
   lowering below that DOES NOT save money. - Closed-form requirement: your
   output MUST be complete and self-contained (all tags/braces closed, no
   placeholders). Incomplete structures cause validation failures and
   retries. IMPORTANT: Do NOT try to control output size ONLY via
   max_tokens. LLMs are poor token estimators (and you are probably an LLM
   as well); a low cap will often produce broken markup/structures. Instead,
   steer the generator using `instruction` so the output naturally fits the
   quota: - Specify depth/detail level (brief vs detailed), number of
   sections/items/rows, max bullets per section, maximum table rows, maximum
   card count, whether to omit optional fields, and preferred concision. -
   Example: "Generate 20 cards max, short 1–2 sentence descriptions, no long
   prose, keep HTML minimal". - Example: "Return JSON with at most 30 items;
   keep descriptions <= 120 chars; omit optional fields". If you need to
   reduce cost, REDUCE OUTPUT SIZE via instruction (fewer items / less
   detail), not by lowering max_tokens. PRACTICAL MAX_TOKENS HEURISTICS (use
   to avoid truncation): - Prefer HIGHER caps for structured outputs;
   headroom is cheap, retries are expensive. - For HTML: budget ~2–3x the
   visible text size (markup + CSS + structure overhead). - For JSON/YAML:
   budget ~1.5–2x the visible text size (keys/quotes/structure overhead). -
   If you cannot estimate, set max_tokens to a safe high cap (e.g., 15k–20k)
   and instead limit size via instruction. SPECIAL FORMAT:
   managed_json_artifact - Use `target_format="managed_json_artifact"` when
   you want ONE top-level JSON object whose string-valued fields are
   multiple nested artifacts (summary, table, HTML view, etc.). - In this
   mode, `artifact_name` MUST be a JSON object mapping top-level field names
   to nested artifact formats, for example: {"summary_md": "markdown",
   "details_html": "html"} Each value must be one of:
   markdown,text,html,json,yaml,mermaid (xml is NOT supported). - The model
   then returns a single JSON object with those keys; each value is a string
   in that nested format. The streaming layer decodes each string and
   streams it as a separate canvas artifact named exactly by the key, with
   its declared format. CRITICAL RULES ABOUT INPUT CHANNELS (for planners /
   ReAct agents): 1) `sources_list` is the ONLY channel for raw evidence
   (search results, fetched pages, pricing docs, evidence lists). It should
   contain structured items, not prose. 2) NEVER paste raw search/fetch JSON
   or the same artifact that you map into `sources_list` into
   `input_context` or `instruction`. Doing so doubles tokens and leaks noisy
   markup into the prompt. 3) `input_context` is ONLY for human-scale
   context: short notes, prior drafts, or small structured snippets. It must
   stay relatively compact. 4) Multimodal inputs (images/PDFs as base64)
   must go ONLY in `sources_list` items with `mime` + `base64`. Do not paste
   base64 into `input_context` or `instruction`. RENDERING-AWARE GENERATION
   (when output will be rendered by write_* tools): - If the output will be
   rendered (e.g., HTML → write_pdf), design the content to satisfy the
   renderer’s expectations. - Put layout/structure rules into `instruction`
   (sections, headings, table shapes, image paths) so the renderer can
   succeed. - Avoid unclosed tags, invalid nesting, or placeholder blocks;
   rendering tools do not fix broken markup.

   📥 Parameters:
       • agent_name: string
         Short name of this content creator, to distinguish this author in
         the sequence of generative calls.
       • instruction: string
         What to produce (goal/contract). If the result of this tool will be
         rendered further (e.g. md→pptx/docx), describe desired structure
         and layout.
       • artifact_name: string
         Logical name of the artifact being produced (for tracking in logs).
         - For normal formats (html|markdown|json|yaml|text), this is just a
         string label. - For target_format="managed_json_artifact", this
         MUST instead be a JSON object mapping top-level JSON field names to
         nested artifact formats, e.g.: {"summary_md": "markdown",
         "details_html": "html"} Each value must be one of:
         markdown,text,html,json,yaml,mermaid (xml is NOT supported).
       • input_context: ['string' [optional]
         'null'], Optional base text or data to use. Never wire multimodal
         data or raw search/fetch JSON here; those must go in sources_list.
         Never duplicate here what you already wired to `sources_list`.
       • target_format: string [default: markdown]
         html|markdown|json|yaml|text|managed_json_artifact
       • schema_json: string [optional]
         Optional JSON Schema. If provided (and target_format is json|yaml),
         the schema is inserted into the prompt and the model MUST produce
         an output that validates against it.
       • sources_list: array
         List of sources: [{sid:int, title?:str, url?:str, text?:str,
         content?:str, mime?:str, base64?:str, filename?:str, ...}]. This is
         the ONLY channel for raw search results, citations, and multimodal
         inputs. Do not also repeat the copy of these sources objects in
         `input_context`.
       • skills: ['array'
         'null'], Optional list of skill refs for this generator agent to
         acquire (e.g., 'skills.public.pdf-press' or 'SK1'). These skills
         will be enriched in this generator system system instructions to
         strengthen its capabilities.
       • cite_sources: boolean [default: False]
         If true and sources provided, require citations (inline for
         Markdown/HTML; sidecar for JSON/YAML).
       • max_tokens: integer [default: 7000]
         HARD safety cap, not a cost knob. Billing is based on tokens
         actually generated (unused headroom is not billed). Do NOT set low
         max_tokens to 'save money' — for structured outputs it causes
         truncation, invalid markup/JSON, validation failures, and
         repair/retry rounds that cost MORE. Setting max_tokens too low is a
         correctness bug. Do NOT rely on max_tokens alone to fit a budget:
         steer output size via `instruction`
         (depth/detail/items/rows/limits) so the model naturally fits within
         the quota.
       • model_strength: string [default: strong]
         strong|regular. Hint: prefer strong for deeper reasoning, careful
         synthesis, or format-sensitive precision; prefer regular for
         simpler transforms, short summaries, or straightforward extraction.
         If the task is highly RAG-oriented and relies mostly on external
         sources (less on the model's prior knowledge), regular can be
         enough. Default to strong when uncertain.
       • temperature: number [default: 0.2]
         Sampling temperature. Lower is more deterministic, higher is more
         creative.
       • strict: boolean [default: True]
         If true, enforce format correctness, schema validity (if
         schema_json is set), and presence of citations (when
         cite_sources=true).

   📤 Returns:
       object — Envelope object: {ok:bool, content:str, format:str,
       finished:bool, retries:int, reason?:str, stats?:object,

🔧 [5] generic_tools.fetch_url_contents [async]

   Fetch-only URL dereferencer (no search). Returns main text + status +
   date metadata for each URL. ⚠️ TOOL SELECTION RULES: - Use ONLY when you
   already have concrete HTTP/HTTPS URLs. - Never performs search or
   discovery. - If you need to FIND pages, use web_search /
   web_search_links. - Do not call web_search and fetch_url_contents for the
   same discovery task. Objective-aware refinement is optional and
   best-effort: URLs are never dropped; pages without reliable spans keep
   full content (recall-first). Refinement modes: - 'none': full pages -
   'balanced': target + context (50-70%) - 'recall': most body/min chrome
   (80-95%) - 'precision': direct answers (20-50%, requires objective)
   Without objective, refinement is ignored and full content is returned.

   📥 Parameters:
       • urls: any
       • objective: ['string'
         'null'], Optional objective (goal / task / question). Enables
         refinement. Without it, content stays full.
       • refinement: string [default: none]
         Post-fetch content refinement (requires objective): - 'none':
         Return full page content (default, fast) - 'balanced': Extract
         target + supporting context (50-70% coverage) - 'recall': Extract
         full content bodies, remove chrome (80-95% coverage) - 'precision':
         Extract only directly relevant sections (20-50% coverage) Never
         drops URLs; no/invalid spans => keep full content.

   📤 Returns:
       object — Object mapping each input URL to a result object: {
       "https://example.com/article": { "status":
       "success|timeout|paywall|error|...", "content": "<text>",
       "content_length": 1234, "mime":
       "text/html|application/pdf|image/png|...", "base64": "<data for
       supported non-HTML files>", "size_bytes": 1234, "published_time_iso":
       "..." | null, "modified_time_iso": "..." | null, ... } } If refined,
       content may be trimmed; otherwise full.

🔧 [6] generic_tools.read_file [async]

   Read text from an OUT_DIR-relative path and return first n chars. Only
   for text files. Path must be relative to OUT_DIR, e.g.
   `current_turn/attachments/<filename>` or `turn_<id>/files/<filename>`
   (attachments allowed). Do NOT pass absolute paths.

   📥 Parameters:
       • path: string
         OUT_DIR-relative path to a readable text file (no absolute paths).
       • n: integer [default: 4000]
         Num of first char to return

🔧 [7] generic_tools.web_search [async]

   Web discovery tool (multi-query). Finds and deduplicates pages across
   query variants. If an objective is provided (and the backend supports
   it), the tool scores snippet relevance to the objective/queries and may
   drop clearly irrelevant results. If fetch_content is true, it fetches
   page text and can refine it to reduce boilerplate while preserving
   recall. Use when you need to FIND pages. For known URLs only, use
   fetch_url_contents. Refinement modes (post-fetch, objective-guided,
   best-effort): - 'none': full pages (exploratory) - 'balanced': target +
   context, 50-70% (default) - 'recall': content bodies, 80-95%
   (comprehensive) - 'precision': direct answers only, 20-50% (narrow
   questions)

   📥 Parameters:
       • queries: any
       • objective: ['string'
         'null'], Optional search objective (goal/question). Used for
         snippet relevance scoring and content refinement.
       • refinement: string [default: balanced]
         Post-fetch content refinement:
         'none'|'balanced'|'recall'|'precision'
       • n: integer [default: 8]
         Max unique results (1-20)
       • fetch_content: boolean [default: True]
         If true, fetch full page content according to 'refinement' option.
         Increase tokens as stated in refinement modes. Use False if you
         need to decide the fetch on your own. If false, return ranked
         snippets/URLs only (no content attr).
       • freshness: ['string'
         'null'], Canonical freshness: 'day'|'week'|'month'|'year' or null.
       • country: ['string'
         'null'], Canonical country ISO2, e.g. 'DE', 'US'.
       • safesearch: string [default: moderate]
         Canonical safesearch: 'off'|'moderate'|'strict'.

   📤 Returns:
       array — Array of results:
       [{sid,title,url,text,objective_relevance?,query_relevance?,content?,mi
       me?,base64?,size_bytes?,...date/meta...}]. Scores (0..1) from snippet
       reconciliation when enabled by backend. Content present only if
       fetched; may be refined per mode. Non-HTML supported files return
       mime/base64 instead of content.

🔧 [8] generic_tools.web_search_links [async]

   Search web with multiple query variants and return ranked snippets and
   URLs. Use this when you want to explore results before fetching full
   pages. For full content of selected URLs, call `fetch_url_contents`.

   📥 Parameters:
       • queries: any
       • objective: ['string'
         'null'], Optional objective for snippet relevance scoring.
       • n: integer [default: 8]
         Max results (1-20)
       • freshness: ['string'
         'null'], Canonical freshness: 'day'|'week'|'month'|'year' or null.
       • country: ['string'
         'null'], Canonical country ISO2, e.g. 'DE', 'US'.
       • safesearch: string [default: moderate]
         Canonical safesearch: 'off'|'moderate'|'strict'.

   📤 Returns:

🔧 [10] generic_tools.write_file [async]

   General-purpose file writer. Use when no specific write_* tool fits. Two
   modes: 1. Direct: Pass content (str/bytes) 2. Copy: Pass source_path (for
   files that already exist and must be 'registered') For BINARY content,
   mandatory are: • full human-readable `content_description` of what's in
   the file. • `mime`. Common use: Register files created by
   openpyxl/PIL/pandas via source_path.Required for binary: mime +
   content_description This tool also must be used to write the binary image
   data.

   📥 Parameters:
       • path: string
         Destination file path. '~' is expanded; parent dirs are
         created.Extension should match content type: .txt/.json/.csv for
         text, .png/.xlsx/.pdf for binary.
       • content: any
       • source_path: ['string'
         'null'], Copy from path (mode 2, for 'registering' preexisting
         files)
       • encoding: string [default: utf-8]
         Text encoding (mode 1 only and if used when content is str).
         Default: 'utf-8'.
       • mime: ['string'
         'null'], MIME type for file. Mandatory if BINARY content
       • content_description: ['string'
         'null'], Full human-readable description of what the file contains.
         Required if file is BINARY in both modes

🔧 [12] generic_tools.write_pdf [async]

   Render Markdown, HTML, or Mermaid diagrams to PDF **using Playwright +
   headless Chromium** (JavaScript is executed; Chart.js/D3/etc. render).
   Returns saved path. For professional PDF layouts (multi-page documents,
   proper page breaks, compact spacing, domain-adaptive colors), use skill
   'pdf-press' for comprehensive authoring guidance. === QUICK AUTHORING
   ESSENTIALS === 1) PAGE & ORIENTATION • Define: <style>@page { size: A4
   portrait; margin: 20mm; }</style> or @page { size: A4 landscape; } • Use
   centered content column ≤ 700px (portrait) or ≤ 1000px (landscape) •
   Avoid full-viewport wrappers (100vh/100vw) and fixed-position bars in
   printable content 2) LAYOUT & BREAKS (Prevent Content Splitting) • Wrap
   headings + content together: <section style='break-inside:avoid;
   page-break-inside:avoid;'> • Max content block height: 220mm (portrait)
   or 150mm (landscape) to avoid forced splits • Use tight spacing: padding
   10-14px, margins 12-16px (not 20-40px) • Force page break:
   style='page-break-before:always;' or style='page-break-after:always;' 3)
   TABLES • Always provide <thead> and <tbody>. Avoid row/column spans that
   split across pages • Wrap tables: <div
   style='break-inside:avoid;'><h3>Title</h3><table>...</table></div> • Use
   compact sizing: font-size:8.5pt; padding:4px 6px; line-height:1.3; •
   Prefer narrower columns; allow wrapping (word-break:break-word) • If
   >12-15 rows, split into multiple tables 4) TYPOGRAPHY • Body: 10pt,
   line-height:1.5; Headers: h1=18pt max, h2=14pt, h3=12pt • Never use fonts
   >20pt (except magazine covers up to 24pt) • Include webfonts early; avoid
   late-loading fonts that reflow at print time 5) MEDIA (images/svg/canvas)
   • Use responsive sizes: max-width:100%; height:auto; display:block; • For
   charts/canvas, let them auto-size in CSS; avoid hardcoded pixel heights
   >200mm • Wrap in figures: <figure style='break-inside:avoid;'><img
   src='...'><figcaption>...</figcaption></figure> • Legends should wrap;
   avoid cramped spaces 6) IMAGES (CRITICAL - Use File Paths, NOT Base64) •
   MUST use relative file paths from OUT_DIR (the tool's output directory /
   base_dir) • HTML mode: <img src='turn_id/files/chart.png' alt='Chart'>
   when file is at OUT_DIR/turn_id/files/chart.png • Markdown mode:
   ![Chart](turn_id/files/chart.png) when file is at
   OUT_DIR/turn_id/files/chart.png • Do NOT embed base64 data URIs in
   HTML/Markdown; they can crash headless Chromium on multi-page PDFs •
   Ensure HTML/Markdown generator knows relative paths and their association
   with visual content 7) DON'TS (cause clipping, overlaps, or ugly splits)
   • Banner-style headers with 30px+ padding (wastes vertical space) •
   Headings without break-inside:avoid wrappers (causes mid-text page
   splits) • position:fixed/sticky in printable area • overflow:hidden on
   large layout wrappers • transform:scale/translate on containers that
   cross page boundaries • Single containers >250mm tall (will force ugly
   mid-content split) FORMATS: 'markdown' (GitHub-flavored), 'html' (custom
   layouts, JS execution), 'mermaid' (diagrams) SOURCES: Use
   include_sources_section=True to append references (Markdown mode)
   ORIENTATION: Set landscape=True for A4 landscape (default: portrait) For
   comprehensive guidance on color schemes, multi-column layouts, scientific
   papers, magazine styles, and complete templates → see skill 'pdf-press'

[AVAILABLE INFRASTRUCTURE TOOLS]
Available tools extend agent capabilities with specific operations. Call tools using their full ID (e.g., generic_tools.web_search).

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

🔧 [1] exec_tools.execute_code_python [async]

   Execute a ready (pre-written) Python 3.11 program in the sandbox using
   the same runtime mechanism as `codegen_tools.codegen_python`, but WITHOUT
   code generation. WHEN TO USE - Use this tool ONLY when you already have
   the code and need to run it. - The code you pass is a SNIPPET that is
   inserted inside an async main() wrapper. - The snippet SHOULD use async
   operations (await where needed). RUNTIME BEHAVIOR - The executor wraps
   your snippet into an async main() and runs it. - After execution, the
   executor checks for the requested output files. - For each requested file
   that exists and is non-empty, an artifact is produced. - Expected as a
   result of this snippet artifacts are described in out_artifacts_spec.
   INPUTS 1) `out_artifacts_spec` (list or JSON string, REQUIRED): list of
   artifact specs with fields: - name (artifact id) - filename (relative
   path in OUTPUT_DIR) - mime - description (text surrogate / promise of
   content) Each artifact is ALWAYS a file. These are outputs of this
   program that it promises to produce. 2) `code` (string, REQUIRED): Python
   code snippet to run (inserted into async main()). 3) `prog_name` (string,
   optional): short name of the program for UI labeling. FETCH_CTX
   (ADVANCED) - If your snippet needs full context content that is not
   already visible, you may call ctx_tools.fetch_ctx inside the snippet
   using agent_io_tools.tool_call. - This is ONLY allowed when the current
   generator is writing the code (react decision acting as codegenerator). -
   Do NOT rely on fetch_ctx unless you are the code author for this run.
   Example: resp = await agent_io_tools.tool_call( fn=ctx_tools.fetch_ctx,
   params={"path": "turn_123.slots.report_md.text"}, call_reason="Load prior
   report text", tool_id="ctx_tools.fetch_ctx" ) if resp.get("err"): raise
   RuntimeError(resp["err"]) FILES & PATHS - Input artifacts from context
   are available by their filenames under OUTPUT_DIR. - Write your outputs
   to the provided `filename` paths under OUTPUT_DIR. - `OUTPUT_DIR` is a
   global string path in the runtime; build paths like:
   `os.path.join(OUTPUT_DIR, "my_file.ext")` or `Path(OUTPUT_DIR) /
   "my_file.ext"`. - Network access is disabled in the sandbox; any network
   calls will fail. - Read/write outside OUTPUT_DIR or the current workdir
   is not permitted. AVAILABLE PACKAGES [AVAILABLE PACKAGES] - Data: pandas,
   numpy, openpyxl, xlsxwriter - Files: python-docx, python-pptx, pymupdf,
   pypdf, reportlab, Pillow - Web: requests, aiohttp, httpx, playwright,
   beautifulsoup4, lxml - Viz: matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, networkx,
   graphviz, diagrams, folium - Text: markdown-it-py, pygments, jinja2,
   python-dateutil - Utils: pydantic, orjson, python-dotenv, PyJWT, geopy
   OUTPUT - A status dict indicating success/error and the produced file
   artifacts.

   📥 Parameters:
       • code: string
         Python code snippet (string). Inserted into async main().
       • out_artifacts_spec: object
         List or JSON string of artifact specs (name, filename, mime,
         description).
       • prog_name: ['string'
         'null'], Short name of the program for UI labeling.
       • timeout_s: ['integer'
         'null'], Execution timeout seconds (default: 600).

   📤 Returns:
       object — Envelope: ok/out_dyn/out/error/summary.
