Author PNG content that renders at correct size and crop.
- Use write_png with fit='content' (default) to avoid tiny centered output.
- For HTML, wrap content in #render-root and set content_selector.
- Increase width (2200–3200) and zoom (1.2–1.8) for readability.
- Use render_delay_ms for Mermaid/JS layout.
- Use write_png as a visual validation step for Mermaid when needed.
