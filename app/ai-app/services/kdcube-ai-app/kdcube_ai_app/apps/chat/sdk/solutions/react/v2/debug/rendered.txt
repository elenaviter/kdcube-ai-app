New AI tools changed the way we work, but at the same time posed new forms of cyber risk to organizations who adopt them.\nMeanwhile, cybercrime groups employed an evolving menu of techniques to disrupt key industries, forcing businesses and government authorities to shift their emphasis toward operational resilience and managing the long-term financial impact of cyber incidents.  \nHere are five key trends that will shape cyber in 2026:\n**1. AI governance and guardrails now front and center**\nThe adoption of artificial intelligence moved faster over the past year than most anyone could have anticipated. \nAn international arms race has commenced between major economic powers, led by the U.S. and China, over who will lead AI transformation. At the same time, companies are rushing to incorporate AI into their profit models, betting both on major gains in productivity as well as the technology supercharging their core product lines. \nBut this rapid embrace of AI brings growing concerns over whether companies have created the proper guardrails and governance structures to ensure their AI programs are secure and cannot be used by malicious actors to exfiltrate corporate data, exploit customers or compromise supply chains. \n“There is a gap between how fast organizations are adopting AI and the maturity of their governance framework,” Morgan Adamski, cyber, data and tech risk deputy leader at PwC told Cybersecurity Dive. “Many are experimenting with agentic and generative AI to drive productivity or efficiency, but often, there are no guardrails in place from a security perspective.”\nAI has moved quickly to become one of the top business cyber risks among global companies. A January report from Allianz Commercial shows AI risk jumped from number 10 to the [second-leading business risk concern over the past year](https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/ai-surges-business-risk-cybersecurity-holds/809620/), based on a survey of more than 3,300 risk management professionals. \nLook for AI risk to drive organizations in 2026 to focus more on establishing [proper parameters and security for their AI programs](https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/ai-augment-security-identity-soc/803608/).\n**2. Cybersecurity regulatory shifts shape disclosures**\nThe regulatory environment for cyber has undergone significant changes in the past year. The Trump administration shifted toward a more nuanced approach, both in terms of oversight and implementation of cyber risk compared with how the Biden administration regulated it. That means oversight in the information security space is not going away but instead will allow markets forces more room to operate.\n“Rather than uniformly pulling back or pursuing broad regulatory expansion, the government is continuing to assess where clearer expectations, coordination, or enforcement are warranted in response to a dynamic threat landscape,” said Haiman Wong, resident fellow, cybersecurity and emerging threats at the R Street Institute. \nThis is particularly the case for critical infrastructure, which is largely owned by the private sector and already faces heightened cyber risk.\nA November 2025 decision by the Securities and Exchange Commission to [drop a landmark civil fraud case against SolarWinds](https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/sec-drops-civil-fraud-case-solarwinds/806126/) was widely considered a welcome development for the business community. The 2023 suit alleged that SolarWinds failed to disclose known cyber risks to investors during the years leading up to the 2020 Sunburst cyberattacks. \nA federal judge had previously dismissed most of the allegations on the grounds the SEC misapplied a Depression-era law to the company’s alleged failure to implement security controls. That legal resolution was also seen as a win for the CISO community, as SolarWinds’ CISO Tim Brown had also faced enforcement action by the SEC in the regulatory agency’s case. \nSagar Ravi, a partner at McDermott Will & Schulte and a former chief of the Complex Frauds & Cyberscrime Unit at the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York, said the decision to drop the SolarWinds case hopefully signals a move to recognize companies should not be punished for falling victim to sophisticated cyber threat actors. It also emphasizes the need for cyber risk transparency, he said.\n“I think the focus is going to be on [enforcing] cybersecurity disclosure rules” in material incident reports on form 8-K or additional disclosures of strategy in annual reports, Ravi told Cybersecurity Dive. \nRavi hopes the SEC instead emphasizes ensuring proper post-breach disclosure rather than conducting investigations that review pre-incident decision making. \n**3. Cyber insurance enters new phase in pricing, coverage**\nThe insurance market has seen its share of turbulence as it struggled to address cyber risk. For years, companies struggled to obtain cybersecurity coverage amid the increased threat of ransomware and fears about the rise of state-linked hackers.\nMost recently, global insurers have expanded their commitment to cyber risk, and recent legal cases involving [war exclusions language](https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/merck-settlement-notpetya-insurance/703922/) related to the NotPetya attacks has provided greater clarity on coverage. Even so, the insurance industry has begun questioning its dependence on the U.S. market, and whether current premium levels for cyber insurance can remain over the long haul. \nThat could mean diversification of the cyber insurance market. Large corporations in the U.S. represent a significant percentage of U.S. policy holders in the cyber market, so insurance companies need to [expand into new markets](https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/cyber-insurance-reduce-losses-diversification/761128/) such as small- to midsized businesses**,** risk analytics firmCyberCube said in a September report. Specialist insurer Beazley late last year said it remains committed to the U.S. market, but [warned of a weak pricing environment](https://beazley2023tf.q4web.com/news/news-details/2025/Trading-Statement-c8cf23f90/default.aspx) for cybersecurity coverage. \nIn order to maintain favorable coverage, insurers are now heavily scrutinizing enterprise security practices, according to risk experts. \n“Not too long ago, you could get cyber insurance with basic antivirus and a firewall,” Monica Shokrai, head of business risk and insurance at Google Cloud said. “Today, if you don’t have phishing-resistant MFA, XDR and immutable backups, you won’t just pay more. You may not get access to coverage.”\n**4. CVE crisis resolved while patching challenges remain**\nOne of the most pressing challenges for security teams in recent years has been how to identify, prioritize and remediate critical flaws discovered in widely used software.\nThese security vulnerabilities are often the gateway used by hackers to launch malicious cyberattacks by abusing the very security tools and software that critical industries and government agencies rely on to manage and protect their [IT networks and maintain operational resilience](https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/network-security-defects-erode-defense/738387/).\nThe security sector was thrown into crisis in April of last year when U.S. government funding nearly collapsed for the Common Exposures and Vulnerabilities (CVE) program. An agreement was eventually reached between CISA and the Mitre Corp. to maintain support for 11 months, and CISA officials in September [pledged to back future funding](https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/cisa-pledges-robust-support-for-funding-further-development-of-cve-program/760020/), releasing a road map that outlines additional support measures. \n“CISA is asserting our leadership role to modernize the CVE Program, broaden adoption of known exploited vulnerabilities and reduce the prevalence of vulnerabilities by driving adoption of Secure by Design principles,” Nick Andersen, executive assistant director for cybersecurity at CISA told Cybersecurity Dive earlier this month. “In collaboration with the global cybersecurity community, CISA is working to deliver a well-governed, trusted, and responsive CVE Program aimed to enhance the quality of vulnerability data and global cybersecurity resilience.”\nSoftware security experts say the CVE funding crisis is a wake-up call for the industry to develop proactive measures to finally address insecure software.\n“Organizations need multisource, context-aware intelligence layered on top of CVE so each record reflects what actually matters: Exploitability, reach, prevalence in real dependency graphs, and whether there’s a safe upgrade path,” Brian Fox, co-founder and CTO at Sonatype told Cybersecurity Dive.\n**5. Operational resilience becomes the new watchword for cyberattack readiness**\nDuring much of 2025, companies around the globe were forced to confront a significant shift in cyber resilience. Cyber threat groups were no longer focused just on the exfiltration of data as their main objective, but instead on causing massive disruption to business operations. \nA social engineering attack on [UK department store Marks & Spencer](https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/marks-spencer-restores-some-online-order-operations-following-cyberattack/750305/), the hack of United Natural Foods and a crippling hack of [automaker Jaguar Land Rover](https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/auto-sector-cyber-threats-business-continuity/802974/) served as graphic examples in 2025 of how easily a successful cyberattack can disrupt production capacity, as well as major supply chains. \nSecurity researchers said those cyberattacks were part of a deliberate strategy by threat actors to impose maximum pressure on major industries for monetary gain.\n“Over the past year, we witnessed a fundamental shift in the attacker playbook, where financially motivated groups like Muddled Libra (Scattered Spider) moved beyond simple data theft to deliberate operational sabotage,” said Sam Rubin, senior vice president, Unit 42 at Palo Alto Networks. “By exploiting the human element through sophisticated ‘vishing’ and manipulating help desks, these actors proved they could paralyze entire enterprise networks and stop businesses in their tracks to maximize extortion leverage.”\nCorporate boards and C-suite executives are under pressure to ensure cyber risk is a key factor in their overall business resilience strategy, experts said security leaders will be tasked with developing specific plans on how to maintain operations and protect supply chains in the face of a catastrophic IT or security event.\n* [![Set preferred source](https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/static/img/social_icons/article_page/bookmark-add.svg?472316191225)\n  Add us on Google](https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=https://www.cybersecuritydive.com)\n* [![Share this article](https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/static/img/social_icons/share-icon.svg?472316191225)\n  Share](javascript:void(0))\n  + [![Copy link](https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/static/img/social_icons/share_dropdown/share-link-box.svg?472316191225)\n    Copy link](javascript:void(0))\n  + [![Email this page](https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/static/img/social_icons/share_dropdown/email.svg?472316191225)\n    Email](https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#17284462757d7274632a22322527746e75726564727462657e636e3225276365727973643225276378322527607663747f3225277e793225272527252131767a672c5578736e2a7f63636764322456383860606039746e75726564727462657e636e737e61723974787a387972606438223a746e75726564727462657e636e3a6365727973643a25272521382f262724222338)\n  + [![Post to LinkedIn](https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/static/img/social_icons/share_dropdown/linkedin.svg?472316191225)\n    LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A//www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/5-cybersecurity-trends-2026/810354/&title=5%20cybersecurity%20trends%20to%20watch%20in%202026)\n  + [![Post on X](https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/static/img/social_icons/share_dropdown/x.svg?472316191225)\n    X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=5%20cybersecurity%20trends%20to%20watch%20in%202026%20https%3A//www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/5-cybersecurity-trends-2026/810354/%20via%20@CyberSecDive)\n  + [![Share on Facebook](https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/static/img/social_icons/share_dropdown/facebook.svg?472316191225)\n    Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A//www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/5-cybersecurity-trends-2026/810354/)\n  + [![Print this page](https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/static/img/social_icons/share_dropdown/print.svg?472316191225)\n    Print](javascript:window.print())\n* [![License this article](https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/static/img/social_icons/article_page/cart.svg?092716141024)\n  purchase licensing rights](https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/selfservice/article-licensing/submit/?newspostUrl=https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/5-cybersecurity-trends-2026/810354/ \"License\")\nFiled Under:\n[Strategy,](https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/topic/strategy/) \n[Threats,](https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/topic/threats/) \n[Policy & Regulation](https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/topic/regulation/)",

CISA may add top CVEs to the KEV catalog soon.\nTyler Reguly, Associate Director of Fortra, stated to Cybersecurity News that “On first pass, this month looks pretty reasonable – 60 CVEs, including one assigned by the Chrome CNA. When you look a little more closely, you start to realize that there is a lot going on here. February can be a bit of a cold, dull month, but Microsoft has decided to heat things up a bit. The good news, there’s not a lot of CVEs to deal with, the bad news, there’s actually a lot to unpack here. We can’t ignore the fact that there are 6 actively exploited vulnerabilities included in this month’s patch drop. 10% of this month’s vulnerabilities are listed by Microsoft as exploit detected.”\n**Other Patch Tuesday Updates**\n* [FortiSandbox XSS Vulnerability Let Attackers Run Arbitrary Commands](https://cybersecuritynews.com/fortisandbox-xss-vulnerability/)\n* [FortiOS Authentication Bypass Vulnerability Lets Attackers Bypass LDAP Authentication](https://cybersecuritynews.com/fortios-ldap-authentication-bypass-vulnerability/)\n* [Ivanti Endpoint Manager Vulnerability Lets Remote Attacker Leak Arbitrary Data](https://cybersecuritynews.com/multiple-ivanti-endpoint-manager-vulnerability/)\n* [SAP Security Patch Day – Critical SAP CRM and SAP S/4HANA Code Injection Vulnerabilities](https://cybersecuritynews.com/sap-security-patch-day-feburary/)\n**Follow us on [Google News](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqMggKIixDQklTR3dnTWFoY0tGV041WW1WeWMyVmpkWEpwZEhsdVpYZHpMbU52YlNnQVAB?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN:en), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/cybersecurity-news/), and [X](https://x.com/cyber_press_org) for daily cybersecurity updates.

When you look a little more closely, you start to realize that there is a lot going on here. February can be a bit of a cold, dull month, but Microsoft has decided to heat things up a bit. The good news, there’s not a lot of CVEs to deal with, the bad news, there’s actually a lot to unpack here. We can’t ignore the fact that there are 6 actively exploited vulnerabilities included in this month’s patch drop. 10% of this month’s vulnerabilities are listed by Microsoft as exploit detected.”"

CVE-2026-21513 was discovered by Microsoft and GTIG.\nThis suggests that some of these vulnerabilities may have been exploited by the same threat actors or in the same attacks. Google has been tracking attacks conducted by [commercial spyware vendors](https://www.securityweek.com/google-links-over-60-zero-days-to-commercial-spyware-vendors/), [state-sponsored APTs, and profit-driven cybercriminals](https://www.securityweek.com/apts-cybercriminals-widely-exploiting-winrar-vulnerability), but nation-state hackers are often behind campaigns involving these types of zero-days.\nCVE-2026-21510, CVE-2026-21514 and CVE-2026-21513 are all flagged as ‘publicly disclosed’ in [Microsoft’s advisories](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/releaseNote/2026-Feb).\nCVE-2026-21519 was discovered by Microsoft’s own researchers. The tech giant has credited the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike with the discovery of CVE-2026-21533 and Acros Security with CVE-2026-21525.\n*SecurityWeek* has reached out to both Acros and CrowdStrike for information on the attacks exploiting the zero-days and will update this article if they respond.\nIn addition to Windows and Office, Microsoft has patched vulnerabilities in Azure, Windows Defender, Exchange Server, .NET, GitHub Copilot, Edge, and Power BI.\n**UPDATE:** CISA has [added the six zero-days](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2026/02/10/cisa-adds-six-known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog) to its KEV catalog.\nAdam Meyers, Head of Counter Adversary Operations at CrowdStrike, told *SecurityWeek*, “The CVE-2026-21533 exploit binary modifies a service configuration key, replacing it with an attacker-controlled key, which could enable adversaries to escalate privileges to add a new user to the Administrator group. While CrowdStrike does not currently attribute this activity to a specific target or adversary, threat actors possessing the exploit binaries will likely accelerate their attempts to use or sell CVE-2026-21533 in the near term.”\nMitja Kolsek, CEO of Acros Security, told *SecurityWeek*, “We found an exploit for this issue in December 2025 in a public malware repository while searching for an exploit for CVE-2025-59230. This issue turned out to be a 0day at the time, so we [patched it](http://blog.0patch.com/2025/12/free-micropatches-for-windows-remote.html) and reported it to Microsoft. We don’t have any information on it having been exploited, but the quality of the combined exploit for both issues suggested professional work.”\n**Related**: [Patch Tuesday: Adobe Fixes 44 Vulnerabilities in Creative Apps](https://www.securityweek.com/patch-tuesday-adobe-fixes-44-vulnerabilities-in-creative-apps/)\n**Related**: [Russia’s APT28 Rapidly Weaponizes Newly Patched Office Vulnerability](https://www.securityweek.com/russias-apt28-rapidly-weaponizes-newly-patched-office-vulnerability/)\n**Related**: [SmarterTools Hit by Ransomware via Vulnerability in Its Own Product](https://www.securityweek.com/smartertools-hit-by-ransomware-via-vulnerability-in-its-own-product/)\n![](https://www.securityweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Ed-Kovacs.jpg)\nWritten By\n[Eduard Kovacs](https://www.securityweek.com/contributors/eduard-kovacs/ \"Posts by Eduard Kovacs\")\nEduard Kovacs (@EduardKovacs) is the managing editor at SecurityWeek.

ACTIVE 💡[ACTIVE SKILLS]
## Skill: pptx-press (public.pptx-press)
# PPTX Authoring for Professional Slide Decks

## Overview
This skill teaches how to produce HTML that renders cleanly into PPTX slides with professional
styling, proper content density, and reliable layouts. Focus: business presentations, technical
decks, and executive briefings.

## Core Principles

### 1. Content Density
Slides auto-scale content down (to ~70% minimum) if it exceeds available space. Always budget
content to fit comfortably within slide dimensions without requiring aggressive scaling.

### 2. Professional Styling
Use domain-appropriate color schemes, clear hierarchy, and balanced layouts. Avoid decorative
elements that don't serve the message.

### 3. Citation Integration
Citations should be concise inline markers `[n]` with full details in a Sources slide, not
disruptive to slide flow.

## HTML Structure

### Slide Container
```html
<section id="slide-1">
  <h1>Slide Title</h1>
  <p class="subtitle">Optional one-line subtitle</p>
  
  <!-- Body content here -->
</section>
```

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT:**
- **Every slide MUST be wrapped in `<section>` tags** - content outside sections will be silently ignored and won't render
- One `<section>` per slide
- `id` can be any unique identifier
- `<h1>` is the slide title (required for most slides)
- `<p class="subtitle">` for optional subtitle
- All body content goes after title/subtitle

**❌ This will NOT render:**
```html
<body>
  <h1>Title</h1>
  <p>Content...</p>
</body>
```

**✅ This will render:**
```html
<body>
  <section id="slide-1">
    <h1>Title</h1>
    <p>Content...</p>
  </section>
</body>
```

### Supported Body Elements

**Headings:**
```html
<h2>Section Heading</h2>
<h3>Subsection Heading</h3>
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Missing Section Tags (CRITICAL)
```html
<!-- BAD: Content will be silently ignored -->
<body>
  <h1>My Presentation</h1>
  <h2>Section 1</h2>
  <p>Content here...</p>
</body>
```
**Fix:** Wrap ALL content in `<section>` tags. Each section = one slide.
```html
<!-- GOOD: Content will render -->
<body>
  <section id="slide-1">
    <h1>My Presentation</h1>
    <h2>Section 1</h2>
    <p>Content here...</p>
  </section>
</body>
```

### ❌ Content Overload
```html
<!-- BAD: 12 bullets won't fit -->
<ul>
  <li>Point 1 with very long explanation...</li>
  <li>Point 2 with even more text...</li>
  <!-- 10 more bullets -->
</ul>
```
**Fix:** Split into 2-3 slides with 4-6 bullets each.

### ❌ Tiny Columns
```html
<!-- BAD: Each column has 8 bullets -->
<div class="two-column">
  <div class="column">
    <ul><li>...</li><!-- 8 items --></ul>
  </div>
  <div class="column">
    <ul><li>...</li><!-- 8 items --></ul>
  </div>
</div>
```
**Fix:** Max 3-4 bullets per column.

### ❌ Unsupported CSS
```html
<style>
/* BAD: These are ignored */
.box { 
  box-shadow: 0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1); 
  border-radius: 8px;
  transform: scale(1.1);
}
</style>
```
**Fix:** Use only supported properties.

### ❌ Base64 Images
```html
<!-- BAD: Will trigger warning -->
<img src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KG...">
```
**Fix:** Use file paths: `<img src="turn_id/files/chart.png">`

### ❌ Long Titles
```html
<!-- BAD: Title wraps to 3 lines -->
<h1>Comprehensive Analysis of Q4 2025 Financial Performance and Strategic Market Positioning</h1>
```
**Fix:** `<h1>Q4 2025 Financial Performance</h1>` (use subtitle for details)

## Professional Practices

### 1. Visual Hierarchy
```html
<style>
h1 { font-size: 36pt; color: var(--primary); }
h2 { font-size: 28pt; color: var(--primary); margin-top: 0.2in; }
h3 { font-size: 22pt; color: var(--text); }
p { font-size: 18pt; line-height: 1.3; }
</style>
```

### 2. Balanced Layouts
- Single-column: Center-aligned, clear hierarchy
- Two-column: Equal visual weight, related content
- Mixed: Vary layouts between slides for visual interest

### 3. Callout Usage
Use callouts for:
- Key takeaways
- Action items
- Important warnings
- Strategic priorities

Avoid:
- Decorative boxes with no purpose
- Multiple callouts per slide (use max 1-2)

### 4. Color Consistency
- Stick to 2-3 colors per deck (primary + accent + neutrals)
- Use primary for headings and key elements
- Use accent sparingly for emphasis
- Keep backgrounds light for readability

### 5. Reference Links vs Citations
**Use `<div class="reference-link">` when:**
- Listing authoritative sources/standards (data sources, documentation, reports)
- Building a resource/bibliography section
- Links are the primary content

**Use `<sup class="cite">` when:**
- Citing specific facts inline
- Supporting claims with evidence
- Links are secondary to narrative flow

## Image Guidelines

### File Paths (Required)
```html
<!-- Relative from OUT_DIR -->
<img src="turn_id/files/revenue_chart.png" width="640">

<!-- With explicit dimensions -->
<img src="images/architecture.png" style="width:6in; height:4in;">
```

### Sizing
- Specify width OR width+height
- Use inches for print consistency: `width:5in; height:3in;`
- Use pixels for web-friendly: `width="640"` (converts to ~6.7in at 96dpi)
- Images auto-fit to slide width if too large

### Placement
- Top-level images appear below title
- Images in columns appear inline with column content
- Images in callouts appear inside the callout box

## Performance Tips

1. **Keep HTML compact** - Remove unnecessary whitespace
2. **Minimize CSS** - Define common colors as variables, reuse classes
3. **Consolidate slides** - Don't split content unnecessarily
4. **Test content density** - If unsure, err on less content per slide

## Remember
- **CRITICAL: Wrap all content in `<section>` tags** - one section per slide, content outside sections won't render
- Content auto-scales down (min 70%) if too large - avoid this by budgeting properly
- Renderer measures text to determine fit - longer text = more scaling
- Citations render as `[n]` inline - keep factual claims concise
- Sources slide is auto-generated - don't create manually
- Two-column backgrounds/borders are per-column - style individually
- Reference links create clickable paragraph elements - use for resource lists
