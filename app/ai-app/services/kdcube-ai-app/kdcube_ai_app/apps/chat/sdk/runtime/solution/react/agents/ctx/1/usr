# The Turn Session Journal / Operational Digest (Current turn). **Strictly ordered from oldest → newest** for prior turns.
Events are chronological. Do NOT reinterpret later user feedback or decisions as if they occurred before earlier steps.
Memory sections below follow the same oldest→newest ordering as the prior turns above.

Within turn, user message and assistant answer are shown from turn log. Solver artifacts (slots) content is not shown. If available, only their content summary is shown. Use 'show_artifacts' to see any artifact in full on next round
For show_artifacts: text artifacts show full content; unsupported binaries show best-effort surrogate; multimodal-supported artifacts show definition only and are attached as multimodal blocks.
Slots define the turn contract (what must be delivered). Some slots are file slots, but the turn may produce additional files on the way.
All produced files are tracked and can be reused later (e.g., images, spreadsheets). These files also have surrogates and summaries.
Use OUT_DIR-relative file/attachment paths exactly as shown in this journal; do NOT fetch slots to discover paths.
Files from prior turns live under: <turn_id>/files/<filename>; current turn files are just <filename>.
Continuation rule: if a slot lists Sources used (SIDs) and you need more detail than the slot content provides, use sources_pool; re-fetch only if volatile or freshness is required.
All SIDs across turns refer to the global sources_pool below.

Grouped by status: ❌ missing →  ⚠️ draft → ✅ completed.

### ❌ Missing slots (0)
_(none)_

###  ⚠️ Draft / incomplete slots (0)
_(none)_

### ✅ Completed slots (1)
- ✅ `ciso_brief_md` (inline, markdown)
  - Description: Comprehensive markdown brief on what CISOs should know in 2026: threat landscape, regulatory updates, strategic priorities, emerging technologies, and actionable recommendations with citations
  - Content summary: ## Role & inputs
Synthesize 6 research sources into structured markdown CISO brief covering 2026 threat landscape, priorities, and strategic guidance; strong model, low temperature (0.2), citations required, 7000-token budget.

## Output
**Success.** Markdown brief (~19.4 KB, 7 sections + 30+ subsections) with inline citations [[S:1–6]]. Structure: Executive Summary → Threat Landscape (AI, deepfakes, supply chain, ransomware) → Regulatory Environment (NIS2, DORA, SEC) → Strategic Priorities (AI/ML, identity, zero trust, supply chain, resilience) → Emerging Trends (quantum, agentic AI, cloud) → 7 Actionable Recommendations. All major requested aspects present: threat signals, regulatory drivers, CISO priorities ranked, and concrete actions. Citations distributed across all sections; sources_used=[1,2,3,4,5,6] confirms all 6 sources cited.

## Risks, quality & next moves
Adequacy: full; all sources cited, structure matches brief goal, recommendations actionable and grounded. No truncation markers or incomplete sections observed; markdown valid and self-contained. Minor: some recommendations (e.g., #2, #3) cite overlapping source pairs [[S:1,4]], but coverage is comprehensive. Follow-up: none required unless brief will be rendered to PDF/DOCX (confirm layout expectations with write tool).
  - Sources used (SIDs): [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

[SOLVER.COORDINATOR DECISION]
# Planner Guidance

## Coordinator Turn Decision
- Scope: continue_request | single_deliverable
- Depth: single_note | shallow

## Policy (Advisory Posture/Scope)
- turn_scope: continue_request
- project_mode: single_deliverable
- scope_notes: Transform existing CISO brief into visual mind map and export as PDF
- avoid: recreating the brief content, asking user to clarify which content to map
- unit_of_work: single_note
- max_depth: shallow
- contract_notes: Single transformation: brief → Mermaid mindmap → PDF

## Decision & Solvability
- next_step: react_loop
- instructions_for_downstream: Extract hierarchical structure from turn_1769717308644_7xv73s.slots.ciso_brief_md (CISO brief markdown). Generate Mermaid mindmap code with root 'CISO 2026' and branches for: Executive Summary, Threat Landscape (AI threats, deepfakes, supply chain, ransomware), Regulatory Environment (NIS2, DORA, SEC), Strategic Priorities (AI/ML security, identity, zero trust, supply chain, resilience), Emerging Trends (quantum, agentic AI, cloud), Actionable Recommendations. Keep node labels concise (≤8 words). Then render mindmap_mermaid to PDF using write_pdf with format='mermaid', landscape=True for better fit. Use SK2 (Mermaid syntax skill) to ensure diagram is syntactically correct.

## Contract Slots (Output Deliverables)
- mindmap_mermaid (inline, mermaid): Mermaid mindmap diagram code representing the hierarchical structure of the CISO 2026 brief (threat landscape, regulatory environment, strategic priorities, eme
- mindmap_pdf (file, application/pdf): PDF rendering of the CISO 2026 mind map diagram

## Budget Hints (Per-Slot)
- mindmap_mermaid: explore=0, exploit=2, render=0, ctx_reads=1
- mindmap_pdf: explore=0, exploit=0, render=2, ctx_reads=0

## Coordinator Instructions for Downstream
Extract hierarchical structure from turn_1769717308644_7xv73s.slots.ciso_brief_md (CISO brief markdown). Generate Mermaid mindmap code with root 'CISO 2026' and branches for: Executive Summary, Threat Landscape (AI threats, deepfakes, supply chain, ransomware), Regulatory Environment (NIS2, DORA, SEC), Strategic Priorities (AI/ML security, identity, zero trust, supply chain, resilience), Emerging Trends (quantum, agentic AI, cloud), Actionable Recommendations. Keep node labels concise (≤8 words). Then render mindmap_mermaid to PDF using write_pdf with format='mermaid', landscape=True for better fit. Use SK2 (Mermaid syntax skill) to ensure diagram is syntactically correct.

## Notes
- Treat recommended tools as hints, not a fixed chain.
- You may choose tools/params that best fill the contract slots.
- You may adapt steps if context suggests a better path.
