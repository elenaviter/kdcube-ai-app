"""Provider-neutral mail named service.

The ``mail`` namespace models mail as a user realm, not as a specific OAuth
provider. A platform user can connect several mail accounts (Gmail, iCloud,
Yahoo, ...). This provider exposes those accounts and messages through the
standard named-service operations; provider-specific transport remains in the
provider packages such as ``integrations.google.gmail_tools``.
