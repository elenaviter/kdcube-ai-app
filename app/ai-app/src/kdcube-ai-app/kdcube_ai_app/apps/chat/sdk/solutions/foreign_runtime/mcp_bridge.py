# Turn an agent's declared `kind: mcp` tool connections into the standard MCP
# server map — ``{server_id: {url, transport, headers}}`` — for THIS turn's
# user, AS this agent. The agent is a "Delegated By KDCube" entity keyed by
# ``application`` + ``agent_id``, so consent is per-agent: a `delegated: true`
# connection is served with the token the user's per-agent grant already bound
# (read through the Connection Hub named service); when the user has not
# consented, the connection is DROPPED (recorded in ``drop_sink`` as
# ``consent_pending``) instead of any blind call. Those drops are the cue to
# raise the house consent CARD (``announce_connect_required``): the same demand
# + chat event a KDCube-MCP 403 raises, so any wrapped runtime gets the chat's
# real grant affordance instead of prose.
#
# This module STOPS at the server map. The binding step — server map → runtime
# tools/config — is the caller's, per runtime: e.g.
# ``kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.frameworks.langchain.mcp.load_mcp_tools_from_server_map``
# binds it as LangChain tools for a LangGraph agent, and a Claude Code adapter
# injects it into the generated ``.mcp.json``. No langchain/langgraph is
# imported here.
#
# ACCOUNTING (the honest rule — "marked = counted"): binding a tool via MCP does
# not by itself make it accounted; a tool whose KDCube-side implementation runs
# a marked model call IS metered, a plain lookup is not.

    Claude Code's grammar has exactly two MCP shapes and NO wildcard between them:
    ``mcp__<server>`` covers everything that server publishes, ``mcp__<server>__<tool>``
    covers one tool. So a PARTIAL denial has to be expressed one of two ways, and
    which one is cheaper depends on what the admin declared:

    * the connection enumerates its tools (``allowed: [...]``) — the survivors are
      known from config alone, so they are named one by one and no server is
      listed at runtime. This is the cheap path, and the reason a concrete
      ``allowed`` list is the better declaration.
    * the connection is a wildcard (``allowed: ["*"]`` or nothing) — the survivor
      set is unknowable without a live ``tools/list`` handshake, so the whole
      server stays allowed and the denied tools are named in the DENY list, which
      wins over the allow rule.

    Denied tools are named in the deny list in both cases: a rule the model cannot
    talk its way around costs one line and removes the question.

    ``server_ids`` are the servers that actually RESOLVED this turn (post-narrowing,
    post-consent) — a declared server that dropped out gets no rule at all.
    ``tool_overrides`` supplies a surviving tool list for a server whose narrowing
    is computed elsewhere (the named-services door, where the user's pick lands on
    namespaces rather than on the door's own tool names).
