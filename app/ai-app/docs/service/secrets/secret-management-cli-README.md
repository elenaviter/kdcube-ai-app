# Manage KDCube Secrets

`kdcube secrets` is the canonical operator surface for logical KDCube
secrets. Logical operations name an exact key and scope. KDCube resolves the
deployment-selected `ISecretsManager`; KDCube alone chooses the physical store
for each request.

```text
kdcube secrets metadata|get|set|delete|export
                    |
                    | local workdir or remote KDCube endpoint
                    v
authenticated KDCube management API
                    |
                    | live Card admission for delegated operations
                    v
descriptor-selected ISecretsManager
        +-----------+----------------+------------------+
        |           |                |                  |
  secrets-file  host-vault   AWS Secrets Manager   in-memory
```

Backend inspection and migration live below the same noun:

```text
kdcube secrets backend status
kdcube secrets backend host-vault prepare|stage|activate|recover
```

The former `kdcube secrets host-vault ...` spelling remains a compatibility
alias. New procedures use `kdcube secrets backend host-vault ...`.

## Command Matrix

| Command | Authority | Value handling |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `metadata` | Live Card grant for one exact metadata resource | Returns existence, provider, and writability as metadata only. |
| `get` | Live Card grant for one exact value-read resource | Writes one admitted value to `--output`; the terminal receives a receipt. |
| `set` | Live Card grant for one exact value-write resource | Reads the value from a hidden prompt or stdin; returns a receipt. |
| `delete` | Live Card grant for one exact delete resource | Returns whether an exact value existed as metadata only. |
| `export` | Fresh browser-confirmed, one-use admin transaction | Writes an exact manifest or frozen whole-deployment inventory into a new private directory. |
| `backend status` | Local operator access to the runtime workdir | Reports descriptor-selected storage and migration metadata. |
| `backend host-vault ...` | Local deployment operator | Prepares, stages, activates, or recovers the local durable backend. |

The exact delegated operations are:

```text
kdcube.management.secret.metadata.read
kdcube.management.secret.value.read
kdcube.management.secret.value.write
kdcube.management.secret.delete
```

Each request names one exact resource:

```text
urn:kdcube:management:secret:<tenant>:<project>:<scope>:<scope-id>:<key>
```

The Card can grant one exact resource, a trailing namespace selector, or a
whole scope. `Once` is valid only for an exact resource. Namespace and whole-
scope selectors are standing authority and require `Always`. When a broad
selector admits an exact request, the selector owns the policy while the exact
resource owns the provider effect and audit record.

## Select A Deployment

A local command derives the endpoint and coordinates from an initialized
workdir:

```bash
kdcube secrets metadata platform.services.brave.api_key \
  --scope platform \
  --workdir ~/.kdcube/kdcube-runtime/demo-tenant__demo-project
```

Stored CLI defaults can select the same workdir. An explicit workdir wins over
defaults saved for another deployment.

A remote command names the KDCube origin and coordinates explicitly:

```bash
kdcube secrets metadata platform.services.brave.api_key \
  --scope platform \
  --endpoint https://runtime.example \
  --tenant demo-tenant \
  --project demo-project
```

Remote non-loopback endpoints require HTTPS. The same route works when KDCube
runs on ECS; trusted KDCube code reaches the provider selected by that cloud
deployment, normally AWS Secrets Manager with task IAM. Host Vault lifecycle
commands are scoped to local Compose; ECS infrastructure keeps its declared
AWS path.

## Human And Agent Credentials

Delegated metadata, get, set, and delete requests require a live Card-bound
bearer. In an interactive terminal, the CLI asks for it with a hidden prompt:

```text
Delegated KDCube bearer:
```

For an agent or trusted credential helper, `--credential-stdin` reads the
bearer from the first line of standard input. Hidden prompt and stdin are the
only accepted credential inputs; arguments and KDCube environment variables
remain non-secret configuration surfaces.

For `set --credential-stdin --value-stdin`, stdin has one explicit framing
rule:

```text
<delegated bearer><newline><exact secret value through end of stream>
```

The newline terminates the bearer and is excluded from the value. Every byte
after it is the UTF-8 secret value, including any final newline. This lets an
agent keep both values in a controlled process-to-process pipe and out of
command history and process arguments.

The generic KDCube CLI keeps that bearer process-local. A product CLI can add
native credential custody around the reusable library. Connection
Hub does this for its selected host: `connection-hub host authorize` stores an
OAuth session in the platform credential store, and its `secrets host ...`
commands call the same KDCube management models and transports.

## Exact Operations

Metadata returns existence and provider capability:

```bash
kdcube secrets metadata platform.services.brave.api_key \
  --scope platform \
  --workdir ~/.kdcube/kdcube-runtime/demo-tenant__demo-project
```

Set uses a hidden value prompt by default:

```bash
kdcube secrets set platform.services.brave.api_key \
  --scope platform \
  --workdir ~/.kdcube/kdcube-runtime/demo-tenant__demo-project
```

Get requires an explicit output path. On POSIX the file is created with mode
`0600`; on Windows it inherits the selected parent directory's ACL. Existing,
symlink, directory, and non-file targets fail closed unless a regular file is
explicitly replaced.

```bash
umask 077
kdcube secrets get platform.services.brave.api_key \
  --scope platform \
  --output ./brave-api-key.txt \
  --workdir ~/.kdcube/kdcube-runtime/demo-tenant__demo-project
```

Delete targets the same logical key:

```bash
kdcube secrets delete platform.services.brave.api_key \
  --scope platform \
  --workdir ~/.kdcube/kdcube-runtime/demo-tenant__demo-project
```

Bundle keys add one exact application id:

```bash
kdcube secrets metadata connections.oauth_state_secret \
  --scope bundle \
  --bundle-id connection-hub@1-0 \
  --workdir ~/.kdcube/kdcube-runtime/demo-tenant__demo-project
```

User and user-bundle keys use the same provider-neutral surface:

```bash
kdcube secrets metadata provider.refresh_token \
  --scope user \
  --user-id USER_ID \
  --bundle-id connection-hub@1-0 \
  --workdir ~/.kdcube/kdcube-runtime/demo-tenant__demo-project
```

Platform keys always begin with `platform.`. Bundle and user keys are relative
to their explicit scope. Unqualified legacy platform names are rejected.

## Demand-Driven Consent

An absent exact grant returns a structured denial with a same-origin consent
URL. The request includes an invocation id and is default-closed.

```json
{
  "ok": false,
  "status": 403,
  "error": {
    "code": "missing_operation_grant",
    "retryable": false
  },
  "recovery": {
    "type": "consent_required",
    "choices": ["allow_once", "allow_always"]
  }
}
```

In an interactive terminal the CLI opens the consent page, waits for the user,
and retries the identical request once. `--no-open --no-wait --json` is the
agent-oriented mode: the agent presents the returned URL to the user, then
retries with the same explicit `--invocation-id`. A new invocation id is a new
operation attempt.

## Human-Only Export

Descriptor export derives authority from a fresh, exact-manifest browser
transaction, independently of delegated bearers and Card grants:

```bash
kdcube secrets export \
  --platform-key platform.services.brave.api_key \
  --bundle-key connection-hub@1-0=connections.oauth_state_secret \
  --user-key USER_ID=provider.token \
  --user-bundle-key USER_ID/connection-hub@1-0=provider.refresh_token \
  --output-directory ./kdcube-secret-export \
  --endpoint https://runtime.example \
  --tenant demo-tenant \
  --project demo-project
```

Whole export uses the same literal pair and includes every current platform,
bundle, user, and user-bundle value:

```bash
kdcube secrets export \
  --all \
  --output-directory ./kdcube-secret-export \
  --endpoint https://runtime.example \
  --tenant demo-tenant \
  --project demo-project
```

The KDCube page authenticates through the authority configured by that
deployment. For exact export it displays the requested manifest and digest.
For whole export KDCube first freezes the current provider inventory, then
returns only its count and digest to the unauthenticated CLI start request.
Inventory names appear only after the browser has an authenticated KDCube
administrator session; the CLI receives them with the values only during the
approved one-use exchange and verifies the frozen digest again. Explicit
approval issues one PKCE-bound code. The code can be exchanged once. The
destination must be new and receives canonical `secrets.yaml` and
`bundles.secrets.yaml` files.

This is the explicit path back to descriptors after a durable backend becomes
authoritative. Ordinary `set` and `delete` operations update the selected
provider; retained bootstrap descriptor files remain rollback snapshots.

Export is independent of delegated bearers and Cards. It proves a current
administrator browser session plus the explicit one-use decision required by
the deployment's configured assurance adapter. The resulting plaintext files
must be handled as complete administrator credentials.

## Complete Configuration Export And Import

`config export` keeps the private pair beside the ordinary descriptors. In
`secrets-file` mode it copies the current files. With Host Vault or another
provider it starts the browser-confirmed whole export automatically:

```bash
kdcube config export \
  --workdir ~/.kdcube/kdcube-runtime/demo-tenant__demo-project \
  --out-dir ./portable-descriptors \
  --include-platform-descriptors
```

The output directory contains the ordinary descriptor set plus the literal
`secrets.yaml` and `bundles.secrets.yaml`. Whole means all current platform,
bundle, user, and user-bundle values. On POSIX, the directory is owner-only and
both secret files are `0600`.

A Host Vault identity and endpoint belong to one machine. Therefore a portable
full export writes `assembly.yaml` with a `secrets-file`/ephemeral bootstrap
shape and clears the source machine's vault address, certificate name, and
identity path. The secret values remain in the ordinary private pair.

Preview an import into an initialized runtime:

```bash
kdcube config import \
  --workdir ~/.kdcube/kdcube-runtime/demo-tenant__demo-project \
  --descriptors-location ./portable-descriptors \
  --include-platform-descriptors \
  --dry-run
```

For a file-backed target, rerun without `--dry-run`. For a provider-backed
target, confirm after reviewing the dry run:

```bash
kdcube config import \
  --workdir ~/.kdcube/kdcube-runtime/demo-tenant__demo-project \
  --descriptors-location ./portable-descriptors \
  --include-platform-descriptors \
  --yes
```

The hidden prompt accepts the Card-bound delegated bearer. A trusted agent can
use `--credential-stdin`; its Card needs write authority for every imported
target, normally the three whole-deployment selectors shown in Connection
Hub's secret-resource editor.

Provider-backed import preserves the target deployment's existing `secrets`
backend configuration and machine identity. It upserts every value present in
the pair through exact management operations, then applies ordinary
descriptors. Omitted keys remain unchanged; deletion is always explicit. If a
later target is denied, the result reports how many earlier idempotent upserts
completed so the operator can grant, correct, and rerun safely.

For a human whose reusable session is already held by the Connection Hub CLI,
restore the values without extracting that bearer, then apply the remaining
ordinary descriptors while preserving those values:

```bash
connection-hub secrets host import \
  --input-directory ./portable-descriptors \
  --dry-run
connection-hub secrets host import \
  --input-directory ./portable-descriptors \
  --yes

kdcube config import \
  --workdir ~/.kdcube/kdcube-runtime/demo-tenant__demo-project \
  --descriptors-location ./portable-descriptors \
  --include-platform-descriptors \
  --skip-secret-values \
  --dry-run
kdcube config import \
  --workdir ~/.kdcube/kdcube-runtime/demo-tenant__demo-project \
  --descriptors-location ./portable-descriptors \
  --include-platform-descriptors \
  --skip-secret-values
```

`--skip-secret-values` preserves the target's current provider values and
backend identity. It exists for this split human flow; a trusted agent with a
delegated bearer normally uses the single provider-backed `kdcube config
import --yes` command above.

The lower-level equivalent is:

```bash
kdcube secrets import \
  --input-directory ./portable-descriptors \
  --workdir ~/.kdcube/kdcube-runtime/demo-tenant__demo-project \
  --dry-run

kdcube secrets import \
  --input-directory ./portable-descriptors \
  --workdir ~/.kdcube/kdcube-runtime/demo-tenant__demo-project \
  --yes
```

## Reusable Management Library

Application-specific CLIs use the installable `kdcube_cli.management` package
for the provider-neutral protocol:

```python
from kdcube_cli.management import (
    HttpxManagementTransport,
    ManagementClient,
    ManagementRequest,
    ManagementTarget,
    management_view,
)

target = ManagementTarget.create(
    public_base_url="https://runtime.example",
    tenant="demo-tenant",
    project="demo-project",
)
request = ManagementRequest.secret_metadata(
    target,
    scope="platform",
    key="platform.services.brave.api_key",
)
client = ManagementClient(transport=HttpxManagementTransport())
```

The product CLI owns how it acquires and safeguards the delegated bearer, then
passes it only to `ManagementClient.execute`. KDCube owns target validation,
request construction, response bounds, consent-recovery validation,
secret-safe projection, private writers, and browser export. Connection Hub
uses this boundary for its native-store OAuth session and selected-host UX.

## Storage Status And Migration

Migrate an existing file pair before switching runtime code to canonical
identities:

```bash
kdcube secrets namespace migrate \
  --workdir ~/.kdcube/kdcube-runtime/demo-tenant__demo-project \
  --dry-run

kdcube secrets namespace migrate \
  --workdir ~/.kdcube/kdcube-runtime/demo-tenant__demo-project \
  --yes
```

The command moves legacy platform roots below `platform`, moves misplaced
bundle values to `bundles.secrets.yaml`, preserves `users`, and refuses any
conflicting duplicate without writing. It reports keys and counts only.

Inspect a local deployment through secret-free metadata:

```bash
kdcube secrets backend status \
  --workdir ~/.kdcube/kdcube-runtime/demo-tenant__demo-project \
  --json
```

The report distinguishes:

- the provider and service backend in staged `assembly.yaml`;
- the configured authoritative store;
- whether plaintext descriptor files still exist;
- Host Vault `shadow-configured`, `active`, or `not-applicable` state;
- incomplete activation requiring recovery.

Its evidence is explicitly `staged-descriptor` and `runtime_verified: false`.
For a live per-key check, use `metadata`; its result comes from the running
management service and selected provider.

The local Host Vault transition is transactional:

```bash
kdcube secrets backend host-vault prepare --tenant T --project P --dry-run
kdcube secrets backend host-vault prepare --tenant T --project P
kdcube secrets backend host-vault stage --tenant T --project P --dry-run
kdcube secrets backend host-vault stage --tenant T --project P
kdcube secrets backend host-vault activate --tenant T --project P --dry-run
kdcube secrets backend host-vault activate --tenant T --project P --yes
```

`stage` copies and verifies existing file-backed values while
`secrets.provider: secrets-file` remains authoritative. `activate` quiesces
consumers, switches to `secrets-service` backed by `host-vault`, recreates the
required services, performs real-read verification, and rolls back ordinary
failures. It retains bootstrap files for explicit rollback acceptance and
leaves their cleanup to an explicit operator step.
