# Google Integration Docs

One Google OAuth client, one `google` provider, and one `gmail` connector app
serve Gmail, Sheets, Docs, and another Google service added the same way. Each
service adds its claims, scopes, and tools.

Use these docs in this order:

- [Google SDK Integration](google-README.md) - the SDK mechanics: the
  `google.oauth` adapter, connected-account credential resolution, and the scope
  machinery (claim -> provider-scope union, the read-write-supersedes-read-only
  collapse, and the Gmail, Sheets, and Docs execution paths.
- [Google Services Through KDCube (Gmail, Sheets, Docs)](../../../recipes/connections/integrations/google-service-README.md) -
  the end-to-end deployment recipe: provider claims, per-service wiring, connect,
  grant, and verification.

The external operator setup (Google Cloud project, OAuth client, redirect URIs,
and per-service API enablement) lives in the bundle-local
[Connection Hub Google setup](https://github.com/elenaviter/app-ecosystem/blob/main/docs/prokura/frontend/application/integrations/google.md).
