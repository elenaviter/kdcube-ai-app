# ReAct Announce Block (ANNOUNCE banner)

This doc describes how the **announce** block is used for ReAct v2.

## What it is
- An **ephemeral tail block** added by the runtime for each decision round.
- Contains ANNOUNCE️:
  - iteration
  - current plan with status markers
  - authoritative temporal context (UTC + user timezone)
  - optional system notices (e.g., cache TTL pruning)

## Where it appears
- It is appended at the end of the timeline when `timeline(include_announce=True)` is called.
- It is **never cached**.

## Lifecycle
- During the loop: updated each round with a fresh ANNOUNCE.
- On exit: the final announce block is **persisted** into the turn log blocks,
  then announce is cleared.

## Feedback in ANNOUNCE
- Feedback updates are fetched **only at turn start** (timeline load).
- If cache is **hot**, feedback remains in ANNOUNCE each round until a cold turn incorporates it.
- If cache is **cold**, feedback is injected into the target turn(s) and ANNOUNCE shows the same updates
  once with “(incorporated into turn timeline)”.
- After incorporation, those items are **not** repeated in later turns.

## System messages in announce
When cache TTL pruning occurs, the render path appends a one-time announce block
containing a system notice. It appears after the budget section and advises
the agent to use `react.read(path)` to restore truncated context.

## Why it exists
- Keeps high‑frequency state updates out of the cached timeline.
- Allows downstream agents (final answer generator) to see the **last ℹ️ ANNOUNCE ℹ️**
  via the persisted contribution block.

## Example (single plan)
