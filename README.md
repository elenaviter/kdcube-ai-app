# KDCube Agentic Prototyping Platform (KDCube APP)

KDCube APP is a **self‑hosted platform + SDK** for building and operating **agentic chat applications and copilots**.
It ships the full stack: streaming runtime, tool execution, memory/context, economics, and a hosting platform
for multi‑tenant production deployment.

---

## Out of the box

A versatile assistant stack that already supports:

- **Streaming chat** (REST / SSE / Socket.IO) with steps/deltas/status (and many more) events and role-based streaming filtering
- **Tool execution** (local tools + MCP tools) and skills (built in and custom)
- **Code generation + code execution** with isolated runtime
- **ReAct strategic solver agent** operating skills acquisition and exploitation, tools and code execution. Adaptive agents selection, planning, and tool-first/code-first flows.
- **Web Search** multi-backend agent
- **Citations subsystem** (structured citations with sources tracking and in-stream rendering). We do not force the llm to repeat the links or embedded files paths. All produced data is connected to sources used, if any.
- **Memory & context** (retrieval, turn memories, conversation memories, user level memories, signals, reconciliation)
- **Storage and cache**
- **Attachments & artifacts** (upload + generated files + secutirty checks + quality assessment + index + storage)
- **Economics & accounting** (budgets, rate limits, usage reporting)
- **Dynamic UI widgets** (control plane: gate configuration and monitoring, economics configuration, conversations browser, full control over servicing and economics rate limits, spendings reporting, etc.)
- **Knowledge Base** (ingestion + hybrid search + citations)

You can plug your own technologies and existing workflows.

## Platform components

### SDK (build the agent app)
- **Agent runtime**: ReAct, planning, tool‑first, and code‑first flows
- **Streaming channels**: REST + SSE + Socket.IO with token/step events
- **Tools & skills**: local tools + MCP tools, easy custom wiring
- **Memory & context**: turn memories, signals, retrieval, reconciliation
- **Code execution**: isolated Docker runtime for untrusted code
- **Attachments & artifacts**: upload + generated files + storage integration
- **Economics & accounting**: usage tracking, budgets, rate limits, reporting
- **Bundle API**: build workflows in LangGraph, LangChain, or custom Python, let them become reachable and speak via the Bundle API

### Platform (host and scale)
- **Multi‑tenant / multi‑project isolation** (storage + schema + namespaces separation)
- **Gateway**: auth, rate limiting, backpressure, circuit breakers
- **Knowledge Base**: ingestion + embeddings + hybrid search + citations
- **Dynamic UI widgets** rendered from bundles (monitoring, control plane, browsers)
- **Horizontal scaling** with stateless web service + queue/processor

> Bundles are deployable agent apps. Multiple bundles can be registered and selected **per message**.
> One bundle executes per request; different requests can target different bundles.
